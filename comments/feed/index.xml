		<description><![CDATA[I know exactly what you are talking about. I&#039;m trying to take back road trips the way our parents and grandparents took them with the minimal amount of technology possible while on them. I just recently took a road trip for the beginning of the summer/end of my first year of teaching. I managed to only use my phone for gps a couple of times and some photos. I&#039;ll admit though, there are some selfies, but I have to have some proof that I was there haha. I&#039;m going to be writing quite a few posts about road trips and technology and publishing them soon. If you&#039;d like to check out my blog and give any feedback here it is.
