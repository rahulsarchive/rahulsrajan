				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good introduction to personal finance and ways of thinking about money. Kiyosaki introduces the concept of the difference between Assets and Liabilities and how the rich acquire assets, while the poor and middle class acquires liabilities which they think are assets. He explains about the Rat Race and how people fall on this hedonic treadmill where things are never enough. He doesn&#8217;t give any direct methods for achieving financial freedom, just some principle to keep in mind. A quick read and one that will get you started in thinking about personal finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peoples lives are forever controlled by two emotions, Fear and Greed. Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by increasing their spending.</p>
<p>Rule #1 Know the difference between an asset and a liability</p>
<ul>
<li>An asset puts money in your pocket every month and a liability takes money out of it.</li>
<li>People work hard &gt; Income increases &gt; expenses increases</li>
<li>Most end up in making a decision to own a house rather than start an investment portfolio.</li>
<li>Investing in a house results in
<ul>
<li>loss of time, during which other assets could have increased in value.</li>
<li>loss of capital which could have been invested instead of paying for high maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Wealth is s person&#8217;s ability ot survive so many number of days forward, or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?</p></blockquote>
<p>Rule #3 Mind your own business</p>
<p>The rich focus on their asset column while everyone else focuses on their income statement.</p>
<p>Eg- McDonald&#8217;s is not a hamburger business but a real estate one.</p>
<p>The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else&#8217;s business and making that person rich. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your income.</p>
<p>Start minding your own business. Keep your day-time job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home.</p>
<p>Rich people build their asset column first and the income generated from the assets pays for their luxuries.</p>
<p>A government bureaucrat gets paid to spend money and hire people. The more he spends the more people he hires, the larger his organisation becomes. In the government, a large organization is a respected organisation.</p>
<p>The government ideal is to avoid having excess money, if you fail to spend the allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would not be recognized for being efficient. On the other hand business, people are rewarded for having excess money and applauded for their efficiency.</p>
<p>A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body with no soul. It was popular because the income tax rate of a corporation is less than the individual income tax rate. And certain expenses could be paid by the corporation with pre-tax dollars.</p>
<p>Knowledge is power, with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge the world pushes you around.</p>
<p>Financial IQ is made up of knowledge in four areas of expertise</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Investing</li>
<li>Understanding Markets</li>
<li>The Law</li>
</ul>
<p>Tax advantage &#8211; A corporation can pay expenses before paying taxes.</p>
<p>A corporation earns, spends everything it can and is taxed on anything that is left. Its one of the biggest tax loopholes. Eg- by owning your corporation, your vacation can be a board meeting in Hawaii. But its done legally with pre-tax dollars.</p>
<p>The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles like corporation and trusts to protect them from creditors. when someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met with layers of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person owns nothing. They control everything but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich.</p>
<blockquote><p>Often in the real world it is not the smartes who get ahead, but the bold</p></blockquote>
<p>The hardest part of running a company is managing people. Leadership is what you need to learn, If you are not a good leader, you will get shot in the back, just like they do in business.</p>
<p>The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear.</p>
<p>If you have little money and you want to be rich, you must first be focused not balanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford it&#8221;shuts down your brain. &#8220;How can I afford it?&#8221; opens up possibilities and excitement.</p>
<p>Do what you feel in your heart to be right, for you&#8217;ll be criticized anyway. You&#8217;ll be damned if you do and damned if you don&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our culture has educated into believing that the love for money is the root of all evil. It encouraged us to learn a profession so that we can work for money but failed to teach us how money can work for us. It taught us not to worry about our financial future because our company of the government would take care of us when our working days are over.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the hardest things about wealth building is to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd. Its because in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, then it&#8217;s already too late in most instances, look for a new deal.</p>
<p>Many middle managers remain, middle managers, failing to get promoted, because they know how to manage people under them, but not with people above them.</p>
<p>Move a sizable amount of money into a stock of a company that is about to release a product, that will add value to the stock, move your money in for a week to a month, and when the stock goes up, pull the initial amount out and stop worrying about fluctuations of the market, money goes in, money goes out, and you own an asset which was technically free.</p>
<p>Make lots of offers, people who are investors have no idea what it feels like to try and sell something. Always make offers with an escape clause. In real estate, make offers with language that details &#8220;Subject to&#8221;contingencies, such as the approval of a business partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Profits are made in buying not in selling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Three Income</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary Income &#8211; earned income, taxed the most</li>
<li>Portfolio Income &#8211; income derived from paper assets such as stocks and bonds</li>
<li>Passive Income &#8211; income most derived from real estate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing &#8211; Warren Buffet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A book about the psychology of what motivates people. It talks about how to inspire intrinsic motivation and how external rewards are detrimental to our behaviour.</p>
<p>Favourite quote-</p>
<blockquote><p>Being a professional, is doing the  things you love to do, on the days you don&#8217;t feel like doing them.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><strong>The Tom swayer Effect</strong> &#8211; Rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioural alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge.</p>
<p>People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person&#8217;s motivation and behaviour, but in doing so, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining the person&#8217;s intrinsic motivation towards the activity.</p>
<p><strong>The Principle Agent Theory</strong> &#8211; Rewards are addictive in that once offered, a contingent reward makes an agent expect it whenever a similar task is faced, which in turn compels the principal to use rewards over and over again.</p>
<p>Eg- pay your son to take out the trash and he will never do it for free, once the initial money buzz tapers off, you&#8217;ll likely have to increase the payment to continue compliance.</p>
<p>The very presence of goals may lead employees to focus myopically on short term gains and to lose sight of the potential devastating long term effects on the organization.</p>
<p>The approach for a rotuine task,</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a rationale for why the task is necessary.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that the task is boring.</li>
<li>Allow people to complete the task their own way (Autonomy).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and the only offered after the task is complete.</p>
<p>A better solution,</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider non-tangible rewards, praise and positive feedback are much less corrosive that cash and trophies.</li>
<li>Provide useful information, the more feedback focuses on specifics and more the praise is about the effort and strategy, rather than about achieving a  particular goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self Determination theory</strong> &#8211; We have 3 innate psycological needs- <strong>competence, autonomy, relatedness</strong>. When these needs are satisfied, we are motivated, productive and happy.</p>
<p>One source of frustration in the workplace is the frequent mismatch of what people must do and what people can do.</p>
<p><strong>Mundanity of Excellence</strong> &#8211; Those who did the best typically spend the most time and effort on the mundane activites that readied them for the races.</p>
<p>Between the words businesses use and the goals they seek, sit the policies they implement to turn the former into the latter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first books I read in the self-help category, it helped me find a genre of books that I really love. The content is thought-provoking, a good starting point into entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>My Notes</h3>
<blockquote><p>Leadership is defined as creating a future for others which would not have happened otherwise &#8211; Bryan Franklin</p></blockquote>
<p>For fifty thousand years, humans did what they were passionate about, and then they did something else to eat. I don&#8217;t think there is anything written down that says those days are gone forever.</p>
<blockquote><p>People have this idea that either you&#8217;re a cog in the machine, just working for the man, or youré out singing on stage, making your living that way It seems like there is a lot in between.</p></blockquote>
<p>The very best thing you can do when starting a business is to keep your overheads as low as possible and make sure you are getting recurring revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Iteration Velocity</strong> &#8211; When creating a new offering, your primary goal should be to work through each iteration cycle as quickly as possible. An iteration is a structured form of learning that helps you make your offering better. The faster you learn the more quickly you improve.</p>
<blockquote><p>The ardent or insane pursuit of a goal is a good idea if the steps you take along the way prep you for other outcome s each almost as good (or better). If bending the market to your will and shipping on time and doing important and scary work are all things you need to develop along the way, then it really doesn&#8217;t matter much if you don&#8217;t make the goal you set out to reach &#8211; Seth Godin</p></blockquote>
<p>The amount of money you earn is the measure of the value that others place on your contribution.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can have anything you want in life, if you will just help other people get what they want &#8211; Zig Ziglar</p></blockquote>
<p>If you can get people who don&#8217;t know about you to know about you (marketing) and you can convert them into customers (sales) and once they&#8217;re customers, you can lead them from point A to point B, you can accomplish anything on the planet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sell them what they want and give them what they need &#8211; Eben pagan</p></blockquote>
<p>If you try to sell a solution before you&#8217;ve muttually agreed on the problem &#8211; which most salespeople do &#8211; People are mostly not interested.</p>
<p>The essence of building your own brand, people having heard of you &#8211; and having a positive impression &#8211; before you&#8217;ve even met them. If you can create that, doors open for you.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial mindset &#8211; Always look for the highest leverage thing that could be accomplished, and then get it done. Never wait for permission or instructions to make things better.</p>
<p>A reasonable man adapts to his environment. An unreasonable man persists in attempting to adapt his environment to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</p>
<p>A startup needs to learn about the problem, the solution, who the customers are, and getting all these pieces to fit together. An early stage startup is a set of assumptions and you need to test those assumptions systematically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me something that you think is true that very few people agree with.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most influential books I have read on psychology. The book details all the methods used by marketers to capture our attention and to persuade our actions. This can be something as small as laughter tracks in comedy sitcoms or more profound like influencing the actions of POWs in Chinese prison camps. All in all, a good read.</p>
<p>Favourite quote &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>With the sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in that fashion of the animals that we long ago transcended.</p></blockquote>
<h3>My notes</h3>
<h3>1. Weapons of Influence</h3>
<p>When we ask people for a favour, we will be more successful if we provide them with a reason.</p>
<p>Contrast principle &#8211; When two things are presented one after the other, if the second item is fairly different than the first, then we will perceive it to be more different. Eg- Next to an expensive item a less costly one will seem cheaper.</p>
<blockquote><p>Civilization advances by extending the number of operation we can perform without thinking about them &#8211; Alfred North Whitehead.</p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Reciprocation</h3>
<blockquote><p>Pay every debt, as if God write the bill. &#8211; Ralph Walds Emerson</p></blockquote>
<p>We are humans because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honoured network of obligations</p>
<p><strong>Rejection then Retreat technique</strong> &#8211; One way to increase your chance would be to first make a larger request that the other person will reject then you would make a smaller offer that you were interested in all along, provided you have structured your request skillfully.</p>
<h3>3. Commitment and Consistency</h3>
<p>Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.</p>
<p>Commitment is strongest when it is public.</p>
<p><strong>Give it and take it away strategy</strong> &#8211; An advantage is offered that induces a favourable purchase decision then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original price advantage is deftly removed. A way to solve it &#8211;  ask yourself, &#8221; Knowing what I know now, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice again.&#8221;</p>
<h3>4. Social Proof</h3>
<blockquote><p>Where all think alike, no one thinks very much &#8211; Walter Lippmann</p></blockquote>
<p>We view a behaviour as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.</p>
<p>Pluralistic ignorance &#8211; In which each person decided that since nobody is concerned, nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>Werther Effect &#8211; immediately after following a front page suicide story the suicide rate increase dramatically in those geographical areas where the story has been highly publicized.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 95% of the people are imitators and only 5% initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others thatn by any proof we can offer &#8211; Cavett Robert</p></blockquote>
<p>No leader can hope to persuade, regularly and single-handedly, all the members of the group. Thus the most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favour.</p>
<p>Social proof is most powerful for those who feel unfamiliar with their surroundings and must consequently look outwards for evidence on how to behave.</p>
<h3>5. Liking</h3>
<blockquote>
<div>The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client &#8211; Clarence Darrow</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p><strong>Halo Effect</strong> &#8211; One positive character of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by others. Eg- Attractiveness.</p>
<p><strong>The Good Cop/ Bad Cop</strong> &#8211;  The main reason it works is that it gives the impression that someone is on our side.</p>
<p>Our vigilance should be directed towards the fact that undue liking has been generated. The biggest mistakes come when we are fond of the person making that request.</p>
<h3>6. Authority</h3>
</div>

<p><strong>Milgram Experiment</strong> &#8211; &#8216;When it is their job, how much suffering will ordinary people be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent person.&#8217; It has to do with a deep-seated sense of duty to authority. The real culprit was the subjects inability to defy the wishes of his boss.</p>
<p>When confronted with an authority figure&#8217;s influence, think &#8221; is this authority truly an expert&#8221; and the credentials and the relevance of them to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>They might seem to argue with themselves a bit, a good strategy for proving their honesty. Eg- &#8220;Loreal&#8217;s a bit more expensive and worth it&#8221;.</p>
<h3>7. Scarcity</h3>

<blockquote>
<div>The way to love anything is to know that it might be lost &#8211; G.K Chesterton</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of potential loss plays a larger value into human decision making. People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value.</p>
<blockquote><p>The joy is not in experiencing a scarce commodity, but in possessing it. It is important that we not confuse the two.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>The Romeo and Juliet effect</strong>&#8211; The boomerang quality of parental pressure on adolescent behaviour.  Couples suffering from parental interference react by committing themselves more firmly to the partnership.</p>
<p>Only individuals whose freedom in the matter had not been restricted by the law had the inclination to live by it.</p>
<p>For political groups, the most effective strategy is not to publicize their unpopular views, but to get them officially censored and then publish the censorship. It is not that the audience members want to have that information more, it is that they tend to believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons for rulers</strong> &#8211; When it comes to freedom, it is more dangerous to have given for a while than never to have given at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In April this year, I got selected to become part of Kerala Startup Mission&#8217;s Technology Innovation Fellowship program (TIFP). Out of many who applied, twenty were selected from across Kerala.</p>
<p>We were the Third bath of fellows to join startup mission, since its inception. I applied for the program as I wanted to learn more about the startup ecosystem and to be around like-minded people. The opportunity that was before me was enormous.</p>
<p>When I tell people what my job at KSUM is, most of them have difficulty understanding it. In some ways, our jobs may be under defined, it&#8217;s not like a regular 9-5 job. But if I were to boil it down, my job would be to <strong>connect people</strong>. We are the liaison to the Government.<span id="more-2792"></span></p>
<p>We joined on the 24th April for our week long induction program. The program was set to orient us in the direction KSUM was heading. We had talk sessions with a lot of people from varied backgrounds and also visited IEDCs in various colleges across Kerala. What follows is an account of the things I have learned from my interactions and the challenges we face in creating a Startup Ecosystem.</p>
<h4>1. We can ease up on Evangelisation of Entrepreneurship.</h4>
<p>Thanks to a lot of media coverage and sites like YourStory, most students have some idea what Entrepreneurship is. Now our main focus is not to spread the idea of startups but to try and bring as many people from the startup world together so that they can interact among themselves and share their knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>What the students need is a role model, someone they can look up to, someone they can relate with. They want to see that an ordinary guy like them can get into the startup world and be successful. Examples like  Facebook and Apple have become cliched, and students can&#8217;t relate to them. We need stories of ordinary people like you and me, who are running their companies. We want to know what drives them, and what keeps them up at night.</p>
<p>Stories inspire people, and interactions help them relate to that person. Our aim as fellows would be to use our reach and bring together as many people as we can find in the startup ecosystem. We will accomplish this through, conferences, talk sessions, webinars and all means necessary.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship has become a common word in our society these days, but few people really know what it means. <strong> Entrepreneurship is not about starting some unicorn company and moving to America. It&#8217;s about solving real world problems and making people&#8217;s lives better.</strong></p>
<h4>2. How to follow up on Programs/Workshops</h4>
<p>We talked with a lot of IEDC nodal officers in many colleges across the state—and in some form or the other—I heard this common concern. There is no follow up on programs/workshops conducted for students. This seems to be a core problem. We can conduct as many workshops as we like, but if the students don&#8217;t follow up them, then is would all be for nothing.</p>
<p>Usually what happens is that the students participate in some Workshop/ Hackathons and over the course of the programme, they learn something about a new technology. But once it&#8217;s over, very few people follow-up on what they learn. <strong>Most of the programmes conducted for students have no follow-up mechanism.</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, <strong>students come for certificates which they can put on their resumes</strong>, It&#8217;s really sad. This, I fear is the institutionalised mindset, that has been ingrained into students. That, whatever you do as a student, is to get a job in some good company.</p>
<p>Our challenge would be to break this tradition, put some more effort into creating programmes for students, which has some kind of follow-up mechanism. One or two-day workshops are good for spreading awareness, but they are not what we need in the long run.</p>
<p>We need a systematic programme, that addresses an individual&#8217;s needs and follows up on their work. Sounds a lot like a school doesn&#8217;t it? Which brings me to my next point.</p>
<h4>3. How to bring the spirit of Entrepreneurship into <del>the curriculum</del> Children&#8217;s lives.</h4>
<p>I read in a book that,  our educational system — in its entirety — was designed over a century ago to turn out educated and compliant factory workers. The more I look around, the more it seems to be true. There are certain things that our school system is good for, like teaching discipline, encouraging competition etc.</p>
<p>But our educational system has struggled to keep up with the changes in time. As any Darwinian would agree, It is not the fittest that survive, but the one most adaptable to change. Our educational system has a lot of inertia. It has been rolling for quite some time that, we cannot easily stop it or change its direction.</p>
<p>Taking that into consideration, what we want to do it is augment it. Slowly build a new system on top of the existing one until it completely replaces it. Easy to say, but very hard to do.</p>
<p>This point came across when we were talking with the previous batch of fellows. Our aim is not to make everyone start their own company. It might sound like a noble quest, but not an ideal one. <strong>Our aim is to make students ready to enter the startup ecosystem</strong>. What does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>To enter into the corporate world, you need qualifications, but to enter the startup world, you need Skills</strong>. This is where it all boils down to. Students need skills. I doubt that many colleges provide students with skills they need to survive in the current economy. This should be our primary focus for now.</p>
<p>Students can learn their college curriculum, but they should also be given time to explore, to try different things and pick up new skills. So the question is how do we do that? How do we give enough time for students to pursue such skills, while still going through the rigours of formal education?</p>
<p>One answer would be to create an environment of competition. From my experience, I can tell that the students who take part in Workshops/Hackathons work really hard to win. They learn new things and learn to apply them to solve a problem. This is something we can tap into.</p>
<p>Kids are naturally curious, I love it when I talk with them, you can feel their potential for growth. All it takes is the right environment. I&#8217;m suggesting a method where we give real world problems as challenges to students and ask them to solve it. We will extend to them the resources they need.</p>
<p><strong>The point is to make the kids become problem solvers</strong>. Once a person goes through such a task, he/she will be well equipped to handle more problems in the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a method to implement this idea, where we give the governments problems as challenges to students. We will post these challenges for people to solve, and the best ideas to come forward will be given the support they need to implement it. I know there will be a lot of bureaucratic processes to get through before it gets implemented. I feel our government should be more open about its problems, lest they fear that it might be used against them.</p>
<h4>4. How to Spread the knowledge of Digital Fabrication</h4>
<p>Kerala startup mission has signed an MOU with MIT&#8217;s  Center for Bits and Atoms, USA. With their help, KSUM has set up two Fablabs in the state. One in Technopark, Trivandrum and other in KTIZ, Kochi.</p>
<p>Fablabs are a technical prototyping platform that share core capabilities so that people and projects can be shared across them. They started as an outreach programme by MIT and have grown to over 1600 labs around the world. They serve as places where people can go and prototype their ideas and create their own technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fablabs enable you to do now, that which the personal fabricators of tomorrow can do in the future&#8221; — Neil Greshenfeld, Drirector of Center for Bits and Atoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have written a previous article explaining what are fablabs and what you can do with them <a href="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/2017/03/04/mits-fablab-and-kerala-startup-mission/">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>I have been undergoing the fabacademy course for the past 5 months and I have learned a lot from the experience, plus I also got to make some pretty cool stuff along the way. The main thing that I have felt while going through fabacademy is a change in my perspective. No longer am I bound to the — one size fits all — commercial products. I can design and build almost anything. It is truly a great feeling, and you get a certain sense of accomplishment when you create something from scratch. But not many people know of this awesome opportunity they have, and I want to change that.</p>
<p>Our current focus is to bring the art of digital fabrication into Engineering colleges. We are in the process of setting up 20 Mini Fablabs in colleges across the state. They will have the same functionality as ordinary fablabs but in a smaller format. There is also a plan to conduct the fabacademy course as a two-year programme for colleges students. This I believe is a good initiative. Now students get to learn how to apply what they have learned in their curriculum. but still, a challenge remains. How to get students from Arts and Science background interested in Digital Fabrication?</p>
<p>This challenge requires a bit more research to find a suitable method in which we can approach the problem. Fablabs are not just for engineers, it also a place where Artists can come and work as well. Few people know what fablabs are capable of and I intend to change that.</p>
<h4>5. How to bring it all together? The Startup Ecosystem</h4>
<p>KSUM already has a lot of great initiatives like Learning to code, Startup Bootcamp etc. But what we are aiming for is the formation of a startup ecosystem in Kerala. This is our mission. We need to bring together these independent events and make them part of an ecosystem.</p>
<p>Why do we need an ecosystem? It&#8217;s because of a simple index that India lags in, The Ease of Doing Business. We rank 130 on that list. India is a tough economy for starting your business and <strong>our aim through the formation of an ecosystem is to reduce the barrier for entry of people into the startup world.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a lot of smaller communities are present now, so the challenge would be how to bring them all together? This will be something we will be working on quite a lot.</p>
<h4>Epilogue</h4>
<p>It is no longer enough that people know about Entrepreneurship, they must be shown a way to it. We need to bring about more interaction between the people inside the startup community and the ones outside. These interactions will help People find role models they can relate with.</p>
<p>Workshops/Hackathons are good for bringing awareness but focus must be given to creating a follow-up mechanism for these kinds of programs for students.</p>
<p>Our aim is not to make everyone start their own company, it is to make them ready to enter the startup ecosystem. To enter into the corporate world, you need qualifications, but to enter the startup world, you need Skills. Hence we need to bring more skill-based programs for students in colleges. We can do that by providing a challenging environment for students so that they can work on improving their skills.</p>
<p>I suggest a way by which, we should let students bring solutions to the government&#8217;s problems. Give them challenges to work on and provide them with support, stand back and be surprised.</p>
<p>Digital Fabrication is an art, that can be learned by anyone. I want people to embrace this opportunity and learn to be creators. Be the makers of your own technology. If what you build is good, build them for others as well.</p>
<p>The creation of a startup ecosystem will be the culmination of our efforts. We will work to bring together men and machines to make that happen.</p>
<p>This, I believe is the way forward.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m open to suggestions on all that I have shared. I want as many minds to work on this as possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful to be a part of KSUM&#8217;s activities and I hope to accomplish many things. You can reach out to me anytime.</p>

<h3>What are Fab labs?</h3>
<p>Fab labs are a technical prototyping platform, where people can design and build their own technology. Fab labs or Fabrication Laboratories began as an outreach project from MIT&#8217;s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA) headed by Neil Gershenfeld.</p>
<p>Fab labs are designed in a way that people with minimal training can come and work on developing their own technology for personal or commercial use. They comprise of roughly fifty thousand dollars in equipment and materials that can be used to make almost anything. They share core capabilities so that people and projects can be shared across them. This currently includes:<span id="more-2762"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> <strong>computer-controlled laser cutter</strong>, for press-fit assembly of 3D structures from 2D parts</li>
<li><strong>A larger (4&#8217;x8&#8242;) numerically-controlled milling machine</strong>, for making furniture- (and house) sized parts</li>
<li><strong>A sign cutter, to produce printing masks</strong>, flexible circuits, and antennas</li>
<li><strong>A precision (micron resolution) milling machine</strong> to make three-dimensional molds and surface-mount circuit boards</li>
<li><strong>Programming tools</strong> for low-cost high-speed embedded processors</li>
</ul>
<p>This inventory is continuously evolving, towards the goal of a fab lab being able to make a fab lab. The Fab Lab comprises of off-the-shelf, industrial-grade fabrication and electronics tools wrapped in open source software and programmes written by researchers at the MIT.</p>
<p>More than just a prototyping platform, a Fab Lab connects to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers, makers, and innovators &#8211; a knowledge sharing network that spans 30 countries and 24 time zones.</p>
<p>And because all Fab Labs share common tools and processes, the programme is building a global network, a distributed laboratory for research and innovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There has been a digital revolution in communication. Now it is time for a digital revolution in fabrication, where data is turned into products,” — Neil Gershenfeld</p></blockquote>
<p>Usually, entrepreneurs and innovators will have to go to several facilities to produce different parts of their products, like circuit boards, and packaging etc. Fab Labs are designed to provide these facilities in a single place. Thus it enables an entrepreneur to develop a prototype of the actual product and display it to the market and to other stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Kerala Startup mission and MIT Fab labs</h3>
<p>On June 16, 2015, Neil Greshenfeld, Director of Centre for Bits and Atoms, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), arrived in Thiruvananthapuram and met with Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to discuss the details of two Fab Labs being set up in the State.</p>
<p>The Fab lab programme involves setting up state-of-the-art Fabrication laboratories in the state to encourage startups in the technology sector.</p>
<p>With the support of Government of Kerala, Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) has started two MIT Electronics Fabrication labs each at Technopark, Trivandrum and Kerala Technology Innovation Zone (KTIZ), Kochi. The Fab lab in Technopark, Trivandrum is established inside the campus of Indian Institute of Technology and Management- Kerala (IIITM-K).</p>
<h3>Fab Lab Trivandrum</h3>
<p>It is located in the IITMK campus inside Technopark. Technopark has all the infrastructure for making software based innovation, this is a much-needed addition. Fablabs adds Rapid Hardware Prototyping facilities, which will enable more startups to explore technology-based innovations.</p>

<p>In our lab, we have a <strong>60w carbon dioxide lase</strong>r capable of cutting Cardboard, Wood, Acrylic etc. This is a precise machine which is very versatile. You can make a multitude of different structures from engraving your photo or logo on wood, to cutting out press fit assemblies which can be put together to form 3D structures. The process is very quick, and the software is easy to use. All you need is a <strong>vector image</strong> of the item you want to engrave or cut. You can load it to any <strong>vector based software</strong> like <strong>Inkscape, Illustrator</strong> and print it out. The laser works on the basis of colour, we can set some predefined colours on the software and define power and speed settings for it so that we can either engrave or cut depending on the colour we set.

<p>The <a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fabacademy</a> conducts a course on <strong>Digital fabrication</strong> every year. Many labs from across the world host this course and students from many countries participate in them. The Fab Academy is a fast-paced, hands-on learning experience where students plan and execute a new project each week. Each individual documents their progress for each project, resulting in a personal portfolio of technical accomplishments.</p>
<p>I joined the <a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fabacademy</a> Course in January this year, we are the 13th batch of students in the fabacademy. My experience so far has been awesome. You get to learn a lot of stuff in such a short amount of time. Every week we are working on something new. The machines are awesome to work with and the assignments are challenging. This unlike any course I have gone through, The pace is fast, we have one week to learn about the software, hardware, and design and make our assignments. This course is challenging and the rewards are high. You can see my progress on my <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabtrivandrum/students/280/index.html">Fabacademy Archive page</a>.</p>

<p>You may not realize it but you are already a writer. We write every day from Emails and chats to work-related reports. We might not be paying much attention to how we write them, but these words represent who we are.</p>
<p>What you write is often the only chance you&#8217;ll get to present yourself to someone whose business or money or goodwill you need. If you write with broken English and cluttered sentences, you won&#8217;t be leaving a good impression. This does not imply that you use pompous words and extravagant adjectives to make you seem important—the corporate mindset—Writing clear sentences should be the aim.<span id="more-2656"></span></p>
<h2>Why become a polished Writer?</h2>
<p>Some people are fuzzy thinkers, like me. Our minds do not work in a linear fashion, We jump from one train of thought to another in a heartbeat. Though verbal communication might not be our strong suite, writing certainly can be. Writing being strictly a linear form of communication, trains your mind to focus on one thing at a time.</p>
<h3>Writing to influence other people</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the secret to making people do what you want them to do, <strong>Write to them</strong>. And based on how you write,  you can make them want to do something, like change their habits or buy your products.</p>
<p>If you want to get a job, then you need a well-written Resume and Cover letter. If you can&#8217;t influence the Hiring Manager to take the time to go through your resume, then you have failed. <strong>Our success in any field depends on our ability to influence others</strong>. Once you understand this, you will begin to feel the omnipresent power of the written word.</p>
<p>In order to progress on the professional front, the number one skill you need to have is good communication, both verbal and written. If you can condense your thoughts, and deliver them in a concise manner, then you have the world with you.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Story telling as it applies to businees isint about spinng a yarn or a fairly tail. Rather its about how your business exist in the real world: Who you are and what you do for the benefit of others, and how you add value to peoples lives.—Ann Hadely</p></blockquote>
<h3>Writing to Discover yourself</h3>
<p>Writing goes beyond communication, it holds the key for Self Discovery. Through this art, you learn more about yourself, the way you think, your deepest fears, and your highest dreams. Writing, draws out the intangible thoughts inside our minds and gives it a form so that we can understand them better. Often what makes us worry is the ambiguous and intangible nature of our fears, we are scared of the things we can&#8217;t comprehend. <strong>Writing becomes the act of giving a form to our thoughts, capturing the demons in our head.</strong></p>
<p>Like many writers will tell you, <strong>There is something magical about writing</strong>. Write down your dreams, and it will come true. Write down your fears, understand them, and they will haunt you no more.</p>
<blockquote><p>We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect—Anais Nin</p></blockquote>
<h2>How to Improve your writing</h2>
<p>My writing journey began when I decided to start a blog. I created one on WordPress, started writing and never stopped. You can take a similar path or start simple.</p>
<p>My goal is to make you aware of your writing and make a regular habit out of it. Once you take your writing seriously, you realize how difficult it can be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about fiction—where you have to pull a story and characters from the ether, adding swirls and twirls to entice and capture your readers—but presenting cold hard facts through the medium of nonfiction. In many ways, the work of a nonfiction writer is hard, as he is accountable to the facts he is presenting.</p>
<p><strong>The way to begin one&#8217;s writing journey is by reading.</strong> Yes, read great works of literature and learn how they use words, analogies, and how they follow and break rules of grammar. Listen to their voice and understand their style of writing. <strong>Read, be inspired, and write</strong>. This should be your starting point but by any means don&#8217;t get stuck here.</p>
<h3>Flexing your writing muscles: Going to the Writer&#8217;s gym</h3>
<p>Ideally, you should write early, and write every day. Designate a quiet place for writing, clear all distractions, relax and start.</p>
<p>Start by lifting featherweights, 100 words or even 250 words in a single sitting, once you are able to lift these featherweights regularly and without much difficulty, increase the weights. Move on to 500 words then to 750. Only increasing the weights when you are able to comfortably and regularly lift the previous weights.</p>
<p>When you can lift 750 words about a certain topic in one sitting without much difficulty, take pride in your ability, you have accomplished a great deal.</p>
<h3>Overcoming the starting challenges</h3>
<blockquote><p>“Writers don’t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the one who sat down to write it.”—William Zinsser</p></blockquote>
<p>Staring at a blank page and thinking about what to write is the worst thing I dread. To create something from nothing requires a great deal of effort. &#8220;What should I write about&#8221;,&#8221;How do I write about it&#8221;,&#8221;How will the final product look like&#8221; these are all doubts that faze me, even now. No matter how much you write, starting from scratch will be the hardest part of the process.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are writing for yourself. Dont try to visualize the great mass audience, every reader is different. Editors and readers dont know what they want to read until they have read it.”—William Zinsser</p></blockquote>
<p>When I&#8217;m thinking of writing about something, I usually have scattered thoughts—some vague ideas I want to convey—and mostly, only one in ten of those thoughts are really helpful. So I begin collecting those thoughts by writing them down. These small bits of words represent the main idea I want to convey in my writing.</p>
<p>Once I have collected the ideas, I go back and expand on each one, adding more details and filling the gaps. These ideas begin to grow into paragraphs. When every idea is worked on and expanded, I go through the entire article and assemble the different paragraphs, adding transition elements, to give a smooth flow from one paragraph to the other, which the reader can follow. <strong>Great writing isn&#8217;t </strong><strong>written, as much as assembled.</strong></p>
<p>For when you are really stuck</p>
<p>Creating the first draft is going to be the hardest step. And like Jackie Chan in the Drunken Master, Sometimes writing without constraint is good for you. Practice a method called <strong>Brain Vomiting</strong>. Just like regular vomiting, the objective is the same—get stuff out. This is where you Write like you are drunk, hold  nothing back, edit nothing, don&#8217;t even check for spelling, just keep writing what your brain is throwing up. By all means write like shit, give yourself permission to be the worst writer in the world. Once done, you can either rework the gibberish into better gibberish or trash it, you will still gain more experience by putting words on paper. This is a good way to get yourself unstuck when writing.</p>
<p>When your ugly first draft is done, let it rest. It needs time—so do you—to marinate and soak up all the ideas. If you can, put one day between your first draft and further edits.</p>
<h3>Going from good to great</h3>
<p>Once you flesh out your idea, it&#8217;s time to become the reaper. Trim the fat and the bloat, most amateur writers stop at the first draft, but I know you won&#8217;t, you will rework it, taking out elements that don&#8217;t fit and beating the rest of it into shape. Be ruthless, Cull weakling verbs and redundant sentences. Each word you use should earn their place in the sentence. Each line should build on the idea from the previous line. Your first draft will reduce considerably and what you will be left with is the original idea in its clearest form.</p>
<blockquote><p>Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words — Mark Twain</p></blockquote>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<blockquote><p>A point of the craft. if you master the tools of the trade—the fundamentals of interviewing and of orderly construction—and if you bring to the assignment your general intelligence and your humanity. You can write about any subject. That&#8217;s your ticket to an interesting life.—Willian Zinsser</p>
<p>A writer who waits for the ideal condition under which to work will die without putting a word on paper—E.B. White</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Dogs might be Man&#8217;s best friends, but books are a close second. There is something magical about holding a book in your hands, it slows your thought and allows your brain to absorb knowledge. Our phones are always up to date but, we never think of updating ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the right books, you can learn anything on your own, no subject is out of your reach. The time has come. Break free from the Highschool mentality and start learning in the real world. Read more, not just fiction, but books that fundamentally change your perspective, books which split your life to a Before Book (BB) and an After Book (AB).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;re a few of my personal favorites, you can start with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2636"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2dREQld">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a>, by Robert B Cialdini</strong></h2>

This book is a classic, and The best book on Influencing humans ever written. Robert Cialdini unravels the simple reasons of &#8216;Why we do-What we do&#8217; <strong>When you get down to it, We humans are nothing but animals with iPhones.</strong> The majority of our actions are influenced by our emotions. We may not be as rational as we think we are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a marketer, you need to read this book. You understand The power Authority holds over us, How to get people to like a brand by the power of Social proof, and even the infamous &#8216;Good Cop/ Bad Cop&#8217; routine.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With the sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so complex, fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended.”</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2MOZ1"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EBnx45BBL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="On Writing well, William Zinsser" width="155" height="233" /></a>This book forms the core of my writing. Anyone who takes writing seriously should read this book. William Zinsser lays down the foundation for going from, good to a great writer. He taught me that writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. The secret, he says, to good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components, clear thinking becomes clear writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Writers don&#8217;t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the one who sat down to write it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Writing is an act of Ego, you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep you going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are writing for yourself. Dont try to visualize the great mass audience, every reader is different. Editors and readers dont know what they want to read until they have read it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2eiaAiO"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yyzvo-TOL.jpg" alt="Rich dad poor dad" width="160" height="262" /></a>If you are a recent college graduate or in your first job and know nothing about personal finance, you need this book. Robert Kiyosaki lays the ground rules, the fundamentals of how to get rich and stay rich. The rules that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. How taxes were first implemented for the rich and then trickled downwards. He explains the need for Financial IQ, to be able to read numbers (Accounting) and understand them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rule#1 know the difference between an Asset and a Liability and buy Assests. An Asset puts money in your pocket every month, and A liability takes money out of your pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;our culture has educated us into beleving that the love for money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so that we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry about our fiantial fututre because our company or the government would take care of us when our working days are over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key to becoming welthy is the ability to convert ordianry income into passive or portfolio income as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

alt="Everybody writes" width="184" height="274" />One of my favorite books on writing in the modern age. This book is like batman&#8217;s utility belt. It has everything you need to fight crime (optional). It combines the rules for writing good English with all the tools and knowledge required by the modern writer. Hadley taught me to embrace my ugly first draft and not let the tyranny of the finished product stop me from writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Story telling as it applies to businees isint about spinng a yarn or a fairly tail. Rather its about how your business exist in the real world: Who you are and what you do for the benefit of others, and how you add value to peoples lives.</p>
<p>A Compelleing brand story is kind of a gift that gives your audience a way to connect with you as  a person to another and to view your business as whatt it is; a living, breathing entity run by real people offering real value.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shockproof, Shit detector.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Written in a time long forgotten, the rules still apply even today. Everyone should read this book at least once. I often wonder why this book is not taught in school. Kids need to learn these fundamental life skills instead of those useless complex differential equations. This book has helped me a lot when it comes to dealing with people, I&#8217;m always polite and never get mad easily—a trait I got from this book.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Say to yourself over and over: “My popularity, my happiness, and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Action spring out of what we fundamentally desire&#8230;and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in schools, or in politics, is: <strong>First, arouse in the other person an eager want.</strong> He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walk a lonely way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You will be the same today and in five years, except for the people you meet, and the books you read&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="http://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/far-far-away-soria-moria-palace-shimmered-like-gold-theodor-kittelsen.jpg" alt="Quest for the Excuse: Stop Procrastinating" width="900" height="590" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyday my mind is on a quest. A quest to find a reasonable excuse for me to not do anything. Everybody needs a reason to do something and a reason not to do something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people listen to the voice inside their head telling them what to do and like them, I also have one in my head. I call him Greg (egregious). <strong>&#8216;<em>Greg the worrier</em>&#8216;</strong> has prevented me from doing many things I wanted to do. He&#8217;s very good at convincing me. All I have to do is listen to him, and the more I listen to him, the more sense he makes.  <span id="more-2562"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg has excellent memory—even better than me—he can remember all my past failure in an instant. And he&#8217;s very good at organizing my failures and presenting them to me. Greg is my best friend sometimes, we often talk about all the good things that happened in the past and what the future is going to be. But Greg has a problem. He&#8217;s a chronic worrier. I know he&#8217;s only looking out for me, but most times, it gets in the way. He&#8217;s very cautious and does not like to take risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s how a usual conversation takes place between me and Greg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Walking outside and seeing a girl I know]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- I think she&#8217;s alone, I should go talk her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg- Na, she is obviously busy with something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- She&#8217;s looking this way should I make eye contact?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg- What if she talks to you? What are you going to say?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- Too late she saw me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>*walks up to girl*</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;Hi there!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Girl- &#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;How are you today?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her- &#8220;Fine, you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;I&#8217;m good, you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>*awkward silence*</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- Greg, I need your help. Greg?&#8230;.Greg?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg-*<em>wispers</em>* I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(It&#8217;s like God is challenging me to get girls on Legendary Mode.)</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">The Omnipresent Greg.</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I know I&#8217;m not alone, many people have their own versions of Greg controlling their actions. Greg is powerful and very convincing once you listen to him. But sometimes Greg is wrong. Almost 90% of the things he makes me worry about, never happen. Greg does so because he is programmed to respond to my strongest emotion. Fear. Our Ancestors feared the dark and all that lay hidden in it. Lions and Leopards are no longer part of our Concrete jungle but we fear something of equal magnitude, social embarrassment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg works with our past, and if you&#8217;re like me and did not have pleasant memories in high school , there&#8217;s a lot more things Greg can make you worry about. Sometimes it becomes a challenge to do simple tasks—like talking to a small group of people—when your own mind is conspiring against you.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How to keep Greg Grounded.</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to convince Greg that there are no more lions in the dark and that nobody from the audience is going to strangle me. I don&#8217;t have complete control over my mind, if I let him, he will squeeze into every corner of thought I have.</p>
<blockquote class="alignright"><p>&#8220;To stop Greg all you have to do is prove him wrong.<br />
Do that enough times and he will shut up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg only has so much power as you let him. One of the best ways I found to deal with him is, to not listen to him. It&#8217;s very hard, especially when doing something you&#8217;re afraid of. If it helps, know that everybody out there has something they fear, even the brave ones. The extroverts are right, sometimes it better not to think. I know the first time I went to talk to my high school crush, I was standing there thinking what I was going to say, then my friend pushed me in front of her—I would not have gone otherwise—and I just said what came to my mind and it went okay.(better than I imagined)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg is only as good as the information he has to work with, you can update what he runs on by learning new things, reading books, mastering a new language or an instrument. The best thing about this is that once you start proving Greg wrong, he tends to quiet down. The more you expand your comfort zone the better you become.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just be sure not to get stuck at the acquiring information stage (<em>Analysis Paralysis</em>). Cover the basics, get on your feet and do it, fill in the information gaps as you go.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Final thoughts</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We all have a voice inside our head guiding us throughout our life. It makes sense to listen to your gut, but know when to stop. Our minds are programmed to fear what we don&#8217;t know. The infinite possible scenarios our mind cooks up never happens. Ignorance is indeed bliss, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next time fear takes a grip, know where it comes from, poor Greg must be scared. Don&#8217;t listen to him, just do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop thinking and prove Greg wrong.</p>

<p>Can a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon create a hurricane in Europe a few weeks later? This is the concept of The Butterfly effect—so named as the computer model that led to its discovery resembles a butterfly—discovered by <strong>Edward Lorentz</strong>. Lorentz  ran weather models with present atmospheric conditions to arrive at the values for tomorrow, he then put the resulting values back in to obtain the conditions of the next day and so on. After many iterations, he found a large variation in the result from the actual condition. On closer inspection, it was observed that every time the new values were put back into the system there was a seemingly small roundoff error at the sixteenth decimal place. This small change was enough to produce a vast difference in the results.<span id="more-2545"></span></p>
<p>The butterfly effect refers to the idea that a butterfly&#8217;s wings might create tiny changes in the atmospheric pressure which combined with other compounding elements may lead to, dissipate or alter the path of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power the tornado, it merely acts as an initial perturbation for the system. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the systems might have been vastly different.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific jargon</strong>: In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.</p>
<h4>How can we apply the Butterfly Effect in our lives?</h4>
<p>if we move this concept from the world of science and apply it  in our lives, a new perspective emerges. To put it in simple terms, the seemingly insignificant choices we make every day can have a large impact on our lives. We do not know how far the ripples of our decision reach. We might consider the everyday interaction between people as trivial, but it can change the entire course of the day for someone.</p>
<p>Suppose you didn&#8217;t have a good night sleep and wake up in a grumpy mood. You are making the morning coffee and your spouse  tells you about an important meeting today, you pay no interest, maybe even act rash. The other person feels offended and his/her mood also deteriorate. Now he carries with him traces of your bad mood and it spreads to everyone he meets on the way to work, from the taxi driver to the assistant. Who then spread it to other people, and thus a chain reaction is set up. He goes into the meeting disinterested, and makes bad decisions. The companies profits go down, he lost the promotion or worse was let go.</p>
<p>Now consider, on the other hand, you woke up in a good mood and cleared your mind. Your spouse can feel it too. Now he goes happily to work, spreading his cheer all along the way, from the taxi driver to the assistant, everyone can feel the effects of your good mood. He goes into the meeting clear-headed and confident. makes the right decisions, profits soar, the company is happy and he gets a promotion.</p>
<p>see how something as small as our mood can set up a chain reaction affecting a lot of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It used to be thought that the events that changed the world were things like big bombs, maniac politicians, huge earthquakes, or vast population movements, but it has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that really change the world, according to Chaos theory, are the tiny things. A butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazonian jungle, and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe.”<br />
― Neil Gaiman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that it&#8217;s not possible to be happy all the time but, the one thing which we can do is to not let our melancholy affect those around us, be it our kids, spouse, co-workers etc. It&#8217;s hard to be cheerful when times are tough and some situation warrants otherwise. But in daily life, most of our problem are solvable without overthinking and worry.</p>
<p>Our behaviour is the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with. Choose them wisely. There are people who are emotional waste dumps, spreading their eternal mystery among friends and co-workers. Stay away from these people who contribute nothing to your life and are constantly bringing you down.</p>
<h4>How can we change the world?</h4>
<p>Start with a something simple. <strong>One random act of kindness a day.</strong> Let these kind butterflies flap their wings and create storms of kindness everywhere around the world. It can be something as simple as helping an old lady cross the street. If an act of kindness is too big a step, then try smiling. Smile at coworkers, strangers on the street, and people  on the subway. It can be hard for many people to smile at strangers, especially for introverts like me. For them, I propose that they execute it in stages, starting with people you know and progressing towards random people on the streets.</p>
<p>Over time these small changes become habits, and there is no better way to change your life than by changing your habits. Charles Duhigg in his book &#8216;The power of habit&#8217; defines a habit, as the choices that all of us deliberately make at one time and stop thinking about,  but continue doing it , often every day. Our small actions can change the course of history, but we may not know it directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Each smallest act of kindness, reverberates across great distances and spans of time affecting lives unknown to the one who’s generous spirit, was the source of this good echo. Because kindness is passed on and grows each time it’s passed until a simple courtesy becomes an act of selfless courage, years later, and far away. Likewise, each small meanness, each expression of hatred, each act of evil.”<br />
― Dean Koontz</p>
