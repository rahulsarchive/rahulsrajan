				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Dogs might be Man&#8217;s best friends, but books are a close second. There is something magical about holding a book in your hands, it slows your thought and allows your brain to absorb knowledge. Our phones are always up to date but, we never think of updating ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the right books, you can learn anything on your own, no subject is out of your reach. The time has come. Break free from the Highschool mentality and start learning in the real world. Read more, not just fiction, but books that fundamentally change your perspective, books which split your life to a Before Book (BB) and an After Book (AB).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;re a few of my personal favorites, you can start with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2636"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2dREQld">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a>, by Robert B Cialdini</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2dREQld"><img class="alignleft" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512-B-1yXuL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Influence Psychology of persuation" width="151" height="227" /></a>Humans are emotional beings, with the right stimulus, we are easily influenced. This book is a classic, and The best book on Influencing humans ever written. Robert Cialdini unravels the simple reasons of &#8216;Why we do-What we do&#8217; <strong>When you get down to it, We humans are nothing but animals with iPhones.</strong> The majority of our actions are influenced by our emotions. We may not be as rational as we think we are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a marketer, you need to read this book. You understand The power Authority holds over us, How to get people to like a brand by the power of Social proof, and even the infamous &#8216;Good Cop/ Bad Cop&#8217; routine.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With the sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so complex, fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended.”</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2MOZ1">On writing well</a>, by William Zinsser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2MOZ1"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EBnx45BBL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="On Writing well, William Zinsser" width="155" height="233" /></a>This book forms the core of my writing. Anyone who takes writing seriously should read this book. William Zinsser lays down the foundation for going from, good to a great writer. He taught me that writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. The secret, he says, to good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components, clear thinking becomes clear writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Writers don&#8217;t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the one who sat down to write it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Writing is an act of Ego, you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep you going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are writing for yourself. Dont try to visualize the great mass audience, every reader is different. Editors and readers dont know what they want to read until they have read it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2eiaAiO">Rich Dad poor Dad</a> &#8211; Robert </strong>Kiyosaki</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2eiaAiO"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yyzvo-TOL.jpg" alt="Rich dad poor dad" width="160" height="262" /></a>If you are a recent college graduate or in your first job and know nothing about personal finance, you need this book. Robert Kiyosaki lays the ground rules, the fundamentals of how to get rich and stay rich. The rules that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. How taxes were first implemented for the rich and then trickled downwards. He explains the need for Financial IQ, to be able to read numbers (Accounting) and understand them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rule#1 know the difference between an Asset and a Liability and buy Assests. An Asset puts money in your pocket every month, and A liability takes money out of your pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;our culture has educated us into beleving that the love for money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so that we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry about our fiantial fututre because our company or the government would take care of us when our working days are over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key to becoming welthy is the ability to convert ordianry income into passive or portfolio income as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2Zzmh">Everybody writes</a>, by Ann </strong>Hadley</h2>

alt="Everybody writes" width="184" height="274" />One of my favorite books on writing in the modern age. This book is like batman&#8217;s utility belt. It has everything you need to fight crime (optional). It combines the rules for writing good English with all the tools and knowledge required by the modern writer. Hadley taught me to embrace my ugly first draft and not let the tyranny of the finished product stop me from writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Story telling as it applies to businees isint about spinng a yarn or a fairly tail. Rather its about how your business exist in the real world: Who you are and what you do for the benefit of others, and how you add value to peoples lives.</p>
<p>A Compelleing brand story is kind of a gift that gives your audience a way to connect with you as  a person to another and to view your business as whatt it is; a living, breathing entity run by real people offering real value.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shockproof, Shit detector.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2eDt0h0">How to win Friends and influence People</a>, by Dale Carnegie</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2687" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL.jpg" alt="How to win friends and influence people" width="188" height="298" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL.jpg 1616w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL-189x300.jpg 189w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL-768x1217.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL-646x1024.jpg 646w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />This is one of the classics, Written in simple English Carnegie explains how the internal clocks of men tick and how we can make them do the things we want without forcing them. Written in a time long forgotten, the rules still apply even today. Everyone should read this book at least once. I often wonder why this book is not taught in school. Kids need to learn these fundamental life skills instead of those useless complex differential equations. This book has helped me a lot when it comes to dealing with people, I&#8217;m always polite and never get mad easily—a trait I got from this book.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Say to yourself over and over: “My popularity, my happiness, and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Action spring out of what we fundamentally desire&#8230;and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in schools, or in politics, is: <strong>First, arouse in the other person an eager want.</strong> He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walk a lonely way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You will be the same today and in five years, except for the people you meet, and the books you read&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="http://images.fineartamerica.com/images/artworkimages/mediumlarge/1/far-far-away-soria-moria-palace-shimmered-like-gold-theodor-kittelsen.jpg" alt="Quest for the Excuse: Stop Procrastinating" width="900" height="590" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyday my mind is on a quest. A quest to find a reasonable excuse for me to not do anything. Everybody needs a reason to do something and a reason not to do something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people listen to the voice inside their head telling them what to do and like them, I also have one in my head. I call him Greg (egregious). <strong>&#8216;<em>Greg the worrier</em>&#8216;</strong> has prevented me from doing many things I wanted to do. He&#8217;s very good at convincing me. All I have to do is listen to him, and the more I listen to him, the more sense he makes.  <span id="more-2562"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg has excellent memory—even better than me—he can remember all my past failure in an instant. And he&#8217;s very good at organizing my failures and presenting them to me. Greg is my best friend sometimes, we often talk about all the good things that happened in the past and what the future is going to be. But Greg has a problem. He&#8217;s a chronic worrier. I know he&#8217;s only looking out for me, but most times, it gets in the way. He&#8217;s very cautious and does not like to take risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s how a usual conversation takes place between me and Greg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Walking outside and seeing a girl I know]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- I think she&#8217;s alone, I should go talk her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg- Na, she is obviously busy with something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- She&#8217;s looking this way should I make eye contact?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg- What if she talks to you? What are you going to say?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- Too late she saw me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>*walks up to girl*</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;Hi there!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Girl- &#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;How are you today?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her- &#8220;Fine, you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;I&#8217;m good, you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>*awkward silence*</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- Greg, I need your help. Greg?&#8230;.Greg?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg-*<em>wispers</em>* I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(It&#8217;s like God is challenging me to get girls on Legendary Mode.)</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">The Omnipresent Greg.</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I know I&#8217;m not alone, many people have their own versions of Greg controlling their actions. Greg is powerful and very convincing once you listen to him. But sometimes Greg is wrong. Almost 90% of the things he makes me worry about, never happen. Greg does so because he is programmed to respond to my strongest emotion. Fear. Our Ancestors feared the dark and all that lay hidden in it. Lions and Leopards are no longer part of our Concrete jungle but we fear something of equal magnitude, social embarrassment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg works with our past, and if you&#8217;re like me and did not have pleasant memories in high school , there&#8217;s a lot more things Greg can make you worry about. Sometimes it becomes a challenge to do simple tasks—like talking to a small group of people—when your own mind is conspiring against you.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How to keep Greg Grounded.</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to convince Greg that there are no more lions in the dark and that nobody from the audience is going to strangle me. I don&#8217;t have complete control over my mind, if I let him, he will squeeze into every corner of thought I have.</p>
<blockquote class="alignright"><p>&#8220;To stop Greg all you have to do is prove him wrong.<br />
Do that enough times and he will shut up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg only has so much power as you let him. One of the best ways I found to deal with him is, to not listen to him. It&#8217;s very hard, especially when doing something you&#8217;re afraid of. If it helps, know that everybody out there has something they fear, even the brave ones. The extroverts are right, sometimes it better not to think. I know the first time I went to talk to my high school crush, I was standing there thinking what I was going to say, then my friend pushed me in front of her—I would not have gone otherwise—and I just said what came to my mind and it went okay.(better than I imagined)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg is only as good as the information he has to work with, you can update what he runs on by learning new things, reading books, mastering a new language or an instrument. The best thing about this is that once you start proving Greg wrong, he tends to quiet down. The more you expand your comfort zone the better you become.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just be sure not to get stuck at the acquiring information stage (<em>Analysis Paralysis</em>). Cover the basics, get on your feet and do it, fill in the information gaps as you go.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Final thoughts</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We all have a voice inside our head guiding us throughout our life. It makes sense to listen to your gut, but know when to stop. Our minds are programmed to fear what we don&#8217;t know. The infinite possible scenarios our mind cooks up never happens. Ignorance is indeed bliss, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next time fear takes a grip, know where it comes from, poor Greg must be scared. Don&#8217;t listen to him, just do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop thinking and prove Greg wrong.</p>

<p>Can a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon create a hurricane in Europe a few weeks later? This is the concept of The Butterfly effect—so named as the computer model that led to its discovery resembles a butterfly—discovered by <strong>Edward Lorentz</strong>. Lorentz  ran weather models with present atmospheric conditions to arrive at the values for tomorrow, he then put the resulting values back in to obtain the conditions of the next day and so on. After many iterations, he found a large variation in the result from the actual condition. On closer inspection, it was observed that every time the new values were put back into the system there was a seemingly small roundoff error at the sixteenth decimal place. This small change was enough to produce a vast difference in the results.<span id="more-2545"></span></p>
<p>The butterfly effect refers to the idea that a butterfly&#8217;s wings might create tiny changes in the atmospheric pressure which combined with other compounding elements may lead to, dissipate or alter the path of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power the tornado, it merely acts as an initial perturbation for the system. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the systems might have been vastly different.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific jargon</strong>: In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.</p>
<h4>How can we apply the Butterfly Effect in our lives?</h4>
<p>if we move this concept from the world of science and apply it  in our lives, a new perspective emerges. To put it in simple terms, the seemingly insignificant choices we make every day can have a large impact on our lives. We do not know how far the ripples of our decision reach. We might consider the everyday interaction between people as trivial, but it can change the entire course of the day for someone.</p>
<p>Suppose you didn&#8217;t have a good night sleep and wake up in a grumpy mood. You are making the morning coffee and your spouse  tells you about an important meeting today, you pay no interest, maybe even act rash. The other person feels offended and his/her mood also deteriorate. Now he carries with him traces of your bad mood and it spreads to everyone he meets on the way to work, from the taxi driver to the assistant. Who then spread it to other people, and thus a chain reaction is set up. He goes into the meeting disinterested, and makes bad decisions. The companies profits go down, he lost the promotion or worse was let go.</p>
<p>Now consider, on the other hand, you woke up in a good mood and cleared your mind. Your spouse can feel it too. Now he goes happily to work, spreading his cheer all along the way, from the taxi driver to the assistant, everyone can feel the effects of your good mood. He goes into the meeting clear-headed and confident. makes the right decisions, profits soar, the company is happy and he gets a promotion.</p>
<p>see how something as small as our mood can set up a chain reaction affecting a lot of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It used to be thought that the events that changed the world were things like big bombs, maniac politicians, huge earthquakes, or vast population movements, but it has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that really change the world, according to Chaos theory, are the tiny things. A butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazonian jungle, and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe.”<br />
― Neil Gaiman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that it&#8217;s not possible to be happy all the time but, the one thing which we can do is to not let our melancholy affect those around us, be it our kids, spouse, co-workers etc. It&#8217;s hard to be cheerful when times are tough and some situation warrants otherwise. But in daily life, most of our problem are solvable without overthinking and worry.</p>
<p>Our behaviour is the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with. Choose them wisely. There are people who are emotional waste dumps, spreading their eternal mystery among friends and co-workers. Stay away from these people who contribute nothing to your life and are constantly bringing you down.</p>
<h4>How can we change the world?</h4>
<p>Start with a something simple. <strong>One random act of kindness a day.</strong> Let these kind butterflies flap their wings and create storms of kindness everywhere around the world. It can be something as simple as helping an old lady cross the street. If an act of kindness is too big a step, then try smiling. Smile at coworkers, strangers on the street, and people  on the subway. It can be hard for many people to smile at strangers, especially for introverts like me. For them, I propose that they execute it in stages, starting with people you know and progressing towards random people on the streets.</p>
<p>Over time these small changes become habits, and there is no better way to change your life than by changing your habits. Charles Duhigg in his book &#8216;The power of habit&#8217; defines a habit, as the choices that all of us deliberately make at one time and stop thinking about,  but continue doing it , often every day. Our small actions can change the course of history, but we may not know it directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Each smallest act of kindness, reverberates across great distances and spans of time affecting lives unknown to the one who’s generous spirit, was the source of this good echo. Because kindness is passed on and grows each time it’s passed until a simple courtesy becomes an act of selfless courage, years later, and far away. Likewise, each small meanness, each expression of hatred, each act of evil.”<br />
― Dean Koontz</p>

<p>I&#8217;m like the majority of 20 somethings when it comes to food habits, which is &#8216;<strong>Eat whatever I like, whenever I like</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p>We quarter-lifers are under a lot of pressure ( college graduation, jobs, starting a family). We find solace and comfort in the foods we eat. They are like therapy.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t blame us for having some extra therapy, we need it. It&#8217;s no wonder the majority of people today are obese or on their way there. I was following the same path.<span id="more-1092"></span></p>
<p>What happened to me was, I got this <em>wonderful</em> condition called <b>Acid reflux</b> (sarcasm). At first, I didn&#8217;t even know about it. There were only occasional throat pains every few weeks and the doctor would prescribe antibiotics, <em><strong>because Antibiotics fix everything</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Well, they made it worse, It destroyed my <em><strong>Intestinal Flora</strong></em>, which were protecting me and laid waste to my stomach.</p>
<p>It was not long after when I started getting chest pain along with throat pain and googling my symptoms did not make me feel better. Trust me, <strong>Never google your symptoms</strong>.</p>
<p>My anxiety sped up the process, soon I went to see a Gastroenterologist. I got admitted and underwent an Endoscopy (not pleasant) and my diagnosis was Antral Gastritis.</p>
<p>After a few week of proton pump inhibitors, my symptoms were subsiding.</p>
<p>But it is not a long-term solution. The only way is to properly control your diet. I&#8217;m sort of a panicky person. So it has been difficult to stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>Trust me Acid reflux is an Insidious condition, it won&#8217;t go down easily.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m stressing the importance of a good diet. processed foods may have increased our palates but they are not a substitute for raw-cooked food.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned my lesson, I&#8217;m trying my best to eat organic but it&#8217;s difficult and expensive. compared with the availability and cheapness of processed items.</p>
<blockquote><p>The best investment you can make to your health insurance is, to eat good food.</p></blockquote>
<p>So kids, always listen to your mother when she says &#8216;eat your vegetables&#8217;.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Entrepreneurs make our world a better place to live in. They are problem solvers. But its the way they create and solve our problems, that makes them Devils in Disguise.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1851" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/devil-in-disguise.jpg" alt="devil-in-disguise" width="698" height="400" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/devil-in-disguise.jpg 698w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/devil-in-disguise-300x172.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order for a company to be successful, its products have to solve a problem faced by the customers. The person who understands that problem, and finds a solution to it, is often called an Entrepreneur. They make our lives easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine the world without entrepreneurs. we would have no Cell phone, no Internet, no Facebook, no eharmony, no Tinder. One can say that they have made the world a better place for us mortals to live in, but often times money is the big motivator. I’m not saying its bad, they should be rewarded for their efforts, for they have created value for other people.<span id="more-575"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Entrepreneurs must have one key skill, They must be an expert on Human Unhappiness.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Today there are products to fill every aspect of our lives, Not looking good? try some beauty products from the world&#8217;s leading brands, Can&#8217;t find a date? look up at the countless dating sites and services. Not content with your life? join a spirituality course to rejuvenate yourself. Every aspect you can think of there are companies there to provide you with their products which can make the job easier for you.Money being the big motivator, in a Capitalistic society<em>, science, and technology will only progress in the direction which is profitable.</em> That means more consumer technologies, and less attention is given to sustainable developments because making the world a better place to live in is bad for business.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">So is it bad?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They are making our lives easier right? true, But my only worry is, Are they making our lives too easy? we now have the capacity to outsource anything. we don’t have to do the hard work of figuring it out ourselves, we can pay someone to do it for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence we will not value an individual’s intelligence anymore, why should we? when we can pay someone else to do it for us. So the only commodity we consumers value would be money.  A person&#8217;s worth will be measured by the amount of money he or she has, because with it, he can buy any service he wants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t get me wrong, I’m not painting a bad picture for Entrepreneurs. I’m speaking about the rest of the world who are consumers and have grown to be dependent on these technologies. Little do they know about the luxuries they have, and the amount of work gone into making them. And with this comes a sense of Entitlement, like the world owes them these luxuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But all is not bad, though we have become a lazy, judgemental, emotionless society we now have the ability to make other people do the work for us. Which is good right?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">So how come they are devils?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entrepreneurs are people like us and most of them are good people but they have a devil’s mind in the sense that, in order for them to sell you a product, you must have a problem that needs solving, and if no genuine problems exist, They will create a problem (need), and sell you the solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what the beauty industry is focused on, to highlight your physical flaws, and sell you a solution. The same as how Airline companies use our inconvenience to make us pay more ( your inconvenience about the boarding and economy seats is used to make you pay more to avoid this hassle and get a business upgrade). As said earlier, an <strong>Entrepreneur must be an expert on Human unhappiness</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">THE WORLD</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The World is increasingly designed to depress us. Happiness isn&#8217;t very good for the economy. If we were happy with what we had, why would we need more? How do you sell an anti-ageing moisturiser? You make someone worry about ageing. How do you get people to vote for a political party? You make them worry about immigration. How do you get them to buy insurance? By making them worry about everything. How do you get them to have plastic surgery? By highlighting their phys-ical flaws. How do you get them to watch a TV show? By making them worry about missing out. How do you get them to buy a new smartphone? By making them feel like they are being left behind. To be calm becomes a kind of revolutionary act. To be happy with your own non-upgraded existence. To be comfortable with our messy, human selves, would not be good for business.  &#8211; Anonymus</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paints a sorry picture doesn&#8217;t it? But we are far too busy to notice this, looking into our new iPhone 6s, posting selfies on Instagram.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are being herded like sheep by the wolves that run Multinational corporations. They have an extensive knowledge of our psychology and are willing to use them against us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s up to you, Do you want to remain a sheep and follow the Herd? Or do you want to wake up, stand on your own feet and learn to think for yourselves?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">NOTE</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to know more about the &#8216;Psychology of persuasion&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Read &#8216;<strong>Ínfluence</strong>&#8216;by <strong>Robert B Cialdini</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a classic and great source of information, His book is one of the best and explains how markets influence us to buy products, in a simple easy to understand way.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s 6 am the sound of bells ringing on my phone wakes me up, struggling to get up and turn off my alarm, only to blinded by the light from the screen burning into my retinas. woke up to do my morning chores, I wander all morning like a zombie. It&#8217;s 7 am I have to get ready for the day, but not before I check my phone to see my notifications. Which I planned would only take me a few minutes, and a whole hour goes by. I&#8217;m late! I run through my chores, often combining them in odd ways. Finally, I&#8217;m ready and off to college.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bus ride usually takes about an hour,  surrounded by people with headphones and with no one to talk to I usually sit and day-dream, about all the things that would never happen to me. I&#8217;m interrupted from my dream by the occasional jolt from the bus and the notification alerts on my phone. Looking down from my ordinary life to the alluring world of digital content, I browse my phone the rest of my journey. This is how a typical day in my life starts.<span id="more-310"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We live in a world where Information travels fast. The pace of life has increased quite appreciably. I wonder how<span style="line-height: 1.7;"> back in the day when a poor pigeon carrying your message, flies on a long journey to find its destination. How  much information could that bird carry, and how fast, Imagine a bird bringing you a message, you roll out the thick paper, written on it in a rustic handwriting it said: &#8220;The king likes your conquest, and the princess is now your follower&#8221;. Certainly, there was no time for trivialities back then, information was valuable and the speed at which the bird flew set the pace for that world.</span></p>
<blockquote class="alignright"><p>&#8220;we spend a sizable portion of our lives engaged in trivialities,</p>
<p>which prevents us from leading a peaceful life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jumping a few decades into the future, we are interrupted every waking moment of our lives by endless notifications and pop-ups. Notifications about your friend&#8217;s cat and how cute she is when she&#8217;s sleeping and another friend who&#8217;s eating a pizza (# biggest pizza ever). Out of 7 billion of us, 4.77 billion  have a mobile phone and that number keeps on growing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever I visit my grandparents in rural India. I find that there is a different pace of life there. There is more of a human connection. Everyone would sit together and talk about all things happening. Family members are interested to know more about my life and they sit down and listen to me when I talk. There is something different when you talk to your grandparents, they come from a different time. A time devoid of cell phones and digital content, Oh how I wish I had a time machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s only my grandparents and older people who are not much affected by technology, I see toddlers playing with phones even when they are as old as three. Their tired mothers, in an effort to make them stop crying, put phones in front of them. The rich content of images, sounds, and videos captivate their brains. That is exactly what digital contents are designed to do. They work on a reward system, rewarding your brain with points and level ups, in an effort to keep you engaged.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The true mark of a successful company is, to build habit-forming products&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our brains have gone from rewarding us for maintaining human connections to leveling-up in candy crush. That is a very sad shift in focus. We no longer actively seek out human connections anymore, not when we have access to thousands of application at our fingertips. Not only the mental shift, there is also a physiological change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The posture of our population is increasingly getting worse, and much to the benefit of chiropractors, almost everybody has back pain! It doesn&#8217;t stop there, Sleeplessness, Myopia, Depression, The list goes on. All these are insidious problems which affect the quality of our life, yet an addicted population is willing to go through all this suffering for the rewards they get.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our generation has the most number of mobile users, but thankfully we had a childhood before technology took over. I can&#8217;t imagine what the kids of today will grow up to be. who will they look up to? us? well, we are not setting an ideal example, are we? When the need for human connection is replaced in a kids brain by technological distractions, he will have a difficult time adjusting to people when he grows up. This leads to a secluded life and that is not a life worth cherishing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">we need to understand how addicted we really are and how our kids are the ones who are going to suffer,  bring a general awareness to this matter. We are in the matrix people! wake up! stop living your lives on autopilot. Go outside, sit on a bench and look at clouds and do nothing for a change. Feel the wind, the sun, the sound of the trees. You don&#8217;t have to talk to other people if you don&#8217;t want to, but it helps. Don&#8217;t work extra hard on your work just so you can go for an expensive &#8216;Tourist&#8217; vacation. You won&#8217;t feel any better when you&#8217;re there. Instead, focus on being in the moment. Take technology breaks whenever possible. In the end, our virtual lives are but mere facades, which masks our inner despair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Carpe Diem, Seize the day!</em></strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[It's not the flesh eating monsters we hoped, but a more insidious one. Invisible yet Omnipresent.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-194" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d951.jpg" alt="3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d95" width="736" height="376" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d951.jpg 736w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d951-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" />A zombie is a person who is or appears lifeless, apathetic, or completely unresponsive to their surroundings. Sounds familiar right and they don&#8217;t just exist in the movies anymore. we see them everywhere, trains, colleges, coffee shops. And sadly for gamers and movie fanatics alike, the modern-day zombie invasion is much more insidious than one might imagine. There are less running and screaming and you don&#8217;t have to sacrifice your fat friend to escape, just a suggestion though.<span id="more-95"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">we live in a world where technology impacts every part of our lives, from communication to Fitness, we have given control of many of our daily activities over to technology,  it has replaced the need for physical or mental exertion. Our technology gets us off our beds, tells us how far we walked, and how far we have to walk in order to burn than pizza we just ate. My point is this, consumer technologies that are designed to help automate our lives are taking away our mental capacity. They are designed for the layman, you don&#8217;t have to think to use them; you know how  we used to drive cars with Manual transmissions, flash forward, we now have smart cars, Driver-less cars. It takes skill to drive a manual, a skill which has been replaced by driver aids, We are dumbing down the human race.</p>
<blockquote class="alignleft"><p>Use technology like Medication, not as vitamins.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember the old days when we remembered our friends birthdays and phone numbers, well those days have passed, and are now replaced by Instant Messaging and Social Media, where we live pseudo lives trying to impress random people and keeping up a pseudo social image. How we have degraded the necessity of the human connections. we spend so much of our waking hours online, we rarely get to live our lives anymore. It&#8217;s like dangling a carrot in front of the donkey, It doesn&#8217;t see anything else, cursed to ever walk towards the unattainable goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The saddest part for me is how we have degraded the value of a simple Photograph. I&#8217;m a Photographer and I enjoy the finer details in one, the story, the lighting, the composition. A Photograph used to mean so much back then, It&#8217;s a slice of time we get to keep, a memory, a simple thing to look back on some day. And to think that this, which used to hold much value then, to be replaced by despicable Duck faces and Boob selfies. It saddens me to the core.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Epigenetics, the study of how external factors affect our genes, tells us that we are affecting the way our cells read our genes. we are leaving behind a legacy of self-destruction and isolation for our kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not to mention how our social and Moral values have shifted, Festivals and family hangouts which used to represent the importance human connections and social values, now become an isolated and distracted place. We do not see, what we have become.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174" src="https://minimalistsconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/albert.jpg" alt="albert" width="500" height="305" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Image Source: Google</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You see people being herded like sheep, people incessantly posting selfies to get attention. People being bombarded with information, which prevents them from thinking. We must strive to be better than that. we must become creators, not consumers, and for the few who can, we must show them a better way to live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carpe diem, Seize the day!.</p>
