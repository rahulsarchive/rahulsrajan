<p style="text-align: center;">I know not what road to take,<br />
for I&#8217;m not sure what lies beyond the bend.<br />
My thoughts travel both ways, but they don&#8217;t reach far.<br />
I ask weary travellers who have travelled each path,<br />
each said the path to be just as fair,<br />
For some did not choose the path.<br />
And others followed in their footsteps.<span id="more-1686"></span><br />
I stand facing two paths, for I have yet to choose.<br />
With how way leads on to way, I know I will not cross this path again.<br />
I wish I could take the one less travelled by.<br />
But fear has stopped me from taking a step.<br />
I wish not to be made a fool, my pride insists.<br />
How can I take a step when I know not where it leads.<br />
I think too much of the outcome, yet I forget to begin.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The day the Wright brothers first flew their flying machine changed the course of history. We now have access to what was once the realm of the birds, no longer bound to our Earthly abode.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My fascination with Airplanes began when I saw my first Airshow with my dad. I was 12 years old. I remember walking up to the beach and suddenly from the treeline I heard a large whooshing sound and looked up to see a large gray Helicopter flash by. That was just the beginning. There were all kinds of aerobatics from Synchronized flying to Sky-writing by  Military Jets.<span id="more-1494"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1794" src="https://minimalistsconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088.jpeg" alt="fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088" width="1280" height="848" srcset="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088.jpeg 1280w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088-300x199.jpeg 300w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088-768x509.jpeg 768w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088-1024x678.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, what went through my mind, was fear. I was scared by the sound and the speed. Then I realized how cool it was, to be a pilot. I wondered what it would be like to be in one of those machines effortlessly cutting its way across the sky. I will forever remember that day as the day I found my life long love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was curious. I wanted to know how they worked. How does a machine that&#8217;s made of metal, float through the air like that? what does it take to become one of the pilots flying it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I tried to learn as much as could about Aircrafts, most of it from watching Television. I remember the day when I set out to make my first helicopter, with my basic understanding of physics. All I knew was I need a propeller spinning very fast to create lift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I took apart an old table fan and cleaned it and oiled it up to make it go fast,  removed all the excess weight of the stand and was left with was the motor, the blade, and the cage. I put the assembly on the floor so that the blade faced downward. and I plugged it in. It was spinning fast. It created a lot of wind but did not lift off like I expected it to. I tried giving it a pull, measuring how much lift it produced and how much weight it needed to lose. It weighed a ton. Hardly any lift at all, I was disappointed. I even got electrocuted, trying to plug the old cable into the socket.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I learned something that day. Big motors, No-No. I needed smaller, lighter  ones. And thus began my journey to take part every toy I had to find motors for my helicopter. I collected propellers from small toys. I would bootstrap designs, but none of them flew. I knew it did not have the power to lift the battery. so my solution was to make it wired. To increase the power, I would add batteries in series. I had burned out the bearing of many motors, they would come to a screeching halt like they are screaming in agony. I was the evil overlord then, torturing my motors until they died.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As time went on my understanding of the laws of flight grew. I understood why helicopters have a tail rotor and realized how my first helicopter design with a single motor and propeller had failed.  I learned about power to weight ratio and was dismayed that all my previous attempts were based on wrong assumptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of engineering that goes into making an Aircraft. The complex intricacies of Angle of attack, Aerofoil shape, Metacenter, Balance and weight distribution. The more I learned the more I realized I had to learn. It was so deliciously complicated. I didn&#8217;t understand the math behind it, but I understood the principles. How a plane flies, the conditions needed for stable flight and how the Angle of attack comes into play.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How does an Airplane fly</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1795" src="https://minimalistsconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288.jpeg" alt="pexels-photo-90288" width="1280" height="853" srcset="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288.jpeg 1280w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288-768x512.jpeg 768w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288-1024x682.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does a plane fly? To put it plainly.<strong> A plane stays up in the air by pushing the air downwards.</strong> The job of the wings is to deflect the air down, thereby keeping the Airplane up.  You can see it in the Joker smile trail left by the aircraft when it moves through clouds. So the faster you go the more air is deflected and the more lift is created. The Angle of attack— the Angle with which the wing meets the oncoming air— is what makes it possible to deflect the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wings might look level, but they are not. They are crafted with a specific Angle of attack. Heavy passenger planes like the Airbus A380 needs high Angles to generate more lift and smaller Military jets requires less.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter the speed, <strong>An airplane&#8217;s wing generates lift equal to its weight.</strong> If that wasn&#8217;t the case then the aircraft would not be able to fly straight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then what&#8217;s with all the movies in which the pilot screams &#8220;We need more speed, we are not going to make it.&#8221; Well, that because the term &#8216;lift&#8217; means different things to the Pilot and the Engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A pilot is not concerned with the lift an aircraft generates, he is concerned with the angle of attack that gives him that lift.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therein lies the dilemma. We think that like a car, a plane moves in the direction it&#8217;s pointing, but that&#8217;s not true. They are ever so slightly pointing up. Landing a plane is same as drifting a car. They are both moving in a different direction than which they are pointing. That is the difference between Lift and Buoyancy (Lowness of Angle of attack). The pilot can make the plane point upwards and still make it fly in a straight line (Mushing flight).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wright brother&#8217;s fundamental contribution was the development of the 3-Axis control system, which enabled a pilot to keep the plane in equilibrium. The vertical stabilizer keeps the nose of the plane from swinging from side to side (yaw). And the horizontal stabilizer prevents an up-and-down motion of the nose (Pitch).</p>
<div id="attachment_1801" style="width: 719px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1801" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/airplane.gif" alt="Airplane parts Definitions" width="709" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Airplane parts Definitions</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the pilot pulls back on the stick, the elevator changes position and increases the pitch of the aircraft, thereby increasing the Angle of attack and hence the generating more lift. So what happens if the pitch is increased too much, then a condition called stall occurs and the aircraft falls from the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A stall is when an increase in Angle of attack will not result in an increase in lift of the aircraft. </strong> In a stall, not enough air flows over the wing, which increases the drag, the plane loses speed and hence lift. During landings a plane&#8217;s tendency to stall is increased, the pilot must have a sense of lift (flying Instinct) to know when the aircraft is near to the stall condition and act accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Elevator changes the pitch of the aircraft, but what makes it go up and down is the Throttle.</strong> Increase the throttle and the plane goes up, decrease it and the plane comes down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Helicopters are a whole different story. They are classified as the Rotary wing type aircraft. Although they follow the same physics, the way they fly is entirely different. I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1805" src="https://minimalistsconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pexels-photo-90283.jpeg" alt="pexels-photo-90283" width="1280" height="853" srcset="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90283.jpeg 1280w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90283-300x200.jpeg 300w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90283-768x512.jpeg 768w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90283-1024x682.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was the kid who tried to make a helicopter out of a table fan. Now, I&#8217;m a Mechanical engineer, but things haven&#8217;t changed much, I still want to build a helicopter. I understand how stupid I was back then, but I&#8217;m glad I was stubborn enough to try. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m the person I am now. My curiosity has only grown in proportion, to my stubbornness of not accepting things as they are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I get goosebumps when I see a pilot deftly making a landing in heavy cross winds. All the conditions that needed to be satisfied to keep that aircraft stable. All the engineering that went into the design, It&#8217;s just beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next time you fly, know the physics of what&#8217;s keeping you in the sky. And enjoy the beautiful Ballet between the Plane and the Air.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m like the majority of 20 somethings when it comes to food habits, which is &#8216;<strong>Eat whatever I like, whenever I like</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p>We quarter-lifers are under a lot of pressure ( college graduation, jobs, starting a family). We find solace and comfort in the foods we eat. They are like therapy.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t blame us for having some extra therapy, we need it. It&#8217;s no wonder the majority of people today are obese or on their way there. I was following the same path.<span id="more-1092"></span></p>
<p>What happened to me was, I got this <em>wonderful</em> condition called <b>Acid reflux</b> (sarcasm). At first, I didn&#8217;t even know about it. There were only occasional throat pains every few weeks and the doctor would prescribe antibiotics, <em><strong>because Antibiotics fix everything</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Well, they made it worse, It destroyed my <em><strong>Intestinal Flora</strong></em>, which were protecting me and laid waste to my stomach.</p>
<p>It was not long after when I started getting chest pain along with throat pain and googling my symptoms did not make me feel better. Trust me, <strong>Never google your symptoms</strong>.</p>
<p>My anxiety sped up the process, soon I went to see a Gastroenterologist. I got admitted and underwent an Endoscopy (not pleasant) and my diagnosis was Antral Gastritis.</p>
<p>After a few week of proton pump inhibitors, my symptoms were subsiding.</p>
<p>But it is not a long-term solution. The only way is to properly control your diet. I&#8217;m sort of a panicky person. So it has been difficult to stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>Trust me Acid reflux is an Insidious condition, it won&#8217;t go down easily.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m stressing the importance of a good diet. processed foods may have increased our palates but they are not a substitute for raw-cooked food.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned my lesson, I&#8217;m trying my best to eat organic but it&#8217;s difficult and expensive. compared with the availability and cheapness of processed items.</p>
<blockquote><p>The best investment you can make to your health insurance is, to eat good food.</p></blockquote>
<p>So kids, always listen to your mother when she says &#8216;eat your vegetables&#8217;.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In order for a company to be successful, its products have to solve a problem faced by the customers. The person who understands that problem, and finds a solution to it, is often called an Entrepreneur. They make our lives easier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine the world without entrepreneurs. we would have no Cell phone, no Internet, no Facebook, no eharmony, no Tinder. One can say that they have made the world a better place for us mortals to live in, but often times money is the big motivator. I’m not saying its bad, they should be rewarded for their efforts, for they have created value for other people.<span id="more-575"></span></p>

Today there are products to fill every aspect of our lives, Not looking good? try some beauty products from the world&#8217;s leading brands, Can&#8217;t find a date? look up at the countless dating sites and services. Not content with your life? join a spirituality course to rejuvenate yourself. Every aspect you can think of there are companies there to provide you with their products which can make the job easier for you.Money being the big motivator, in a Capitalistic society<em>, science, and technology will only progress in the direction which is profitable.</em> That means more consumer technologies, and less attention is given to sustainable developments because making the world a better place to live in is bad for business.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">So is it bad?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They are making our lives easier right? true, But my only worry is, Are they making our lives too easy? we now have the capacity to outsource anything. we don’t have to do the hard work of figuring it out ourselves, we can pay someone to do it for us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hence we will not value an individual’s intelligence anymore, why should we? when we can pay someone else to do it for us. So the only commodity we consumers value would be money.  A person&#8217;s worth will be measured by the amount of money he or she has, because with it, he can buy any service he wants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t get me wrong, I’m not painting a bad picture for Entrepreneurs. I’m speaking about the rest of the world who are consumers and have grown to be dependent on these technologies. Little do they know about the luxuries they have, and the amount of work gone into making them. And with this comes a sense of Entitlement, like the world owes them these luxuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But all is not bad, though we have become a lazy, judgemental, emotionless society we now have the ability to make other people do the work for us. Which is good right?</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">So how come they are devils?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entrepreneurs are people like us and most of them are good people but they have a devil’s mind in the sense that, in order for them to sell you a product, you must have a problem that needs solving, and if no genuine problems exist, They will create a problem (need), and sell you the solution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is what the beauty industry is focused on, to highlight your physical flaws, and sell you a solution. The same as how Airline companies use our inconvenience to make us pay more ( your inconvenience about the boarding and economy seats is used to make you pay more to avoid this hassle and get a business upgrade). As said earlier, an <strong>Entrepreneur must be an expert on Human unhappiness</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">THE WORLD</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The World is increasingly designed to depress us. Happiness isn&#8217;t very good for the economy. If we were happy with what we had, why would we need more? How do you sell an anti-ageing moisturiser? You make someone worry about ageing. How do you get people to vote for a political party? You make them worry about immigration. How do you get them to buy insurance? By making them worry about everything. How do you get them to have plastic surgery? By highlighting their phys-ical flaws. How do you get them to watch a TV show? By making them worry about missing out. How do you get them to buy a new smartphone? By making them feel like they are being left behind. To be calm becomes a kind of revolutionary act. To be happy with your own non-upgraded existence. To be comfortable with our messy, human selves, would not be good for business.  &#8211; Anonymus</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paints a sorry picture doesn&#8217;t it? But we are far too busy to notice this, looking into our new iPhone 6s, posting selfies on Instagram.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are being herded like sheep by the wolves that run Multinational corporations. They have an extensive knowledge of our psychology and are willing to use them against us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s up to you, Do you want to remain a sheep and follow the Herd? Or do you want to wake up, stand on your own feet and learn to think for yourselves?</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">NOTE</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to know more about the &#8216;Psychology of persuasion&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Read &#8216;<strong>Ínfluence</strong>&#8216;by <strong>Robert B Cialdini</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a classic and great source of information, His book is one of the best and explains how markets influence us to buy products, in a simple easy to understand way.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s 6 am the sound of bells ringing on my phone wakes me up, struggling to get up and turn off my alarm, only to blinded by the light from the screen burning into my retinas. woke up to do my morning chores, I wander all morning like a zombie. It&#8217;s 7 am I have to get ready for the day, but not before I check my phone to see my notifications. Which I planned would only take me a few minutes, and a whole hour goes by. I&#8217;m late! I run through my chores, often combining them in odd ways. Finally, I&#8217;m ready and off to college.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bus ride usually takes about an hour,  surrounded by people with headphones and with no one to talk to I usually sit and day-dream, about all the things that would never happen to me. I&#8217;m interrupted from my dream by the occasional jolt from the bus and the notification alerts on my phone. Looking down from my ordinary life to the alluring world of digital content, I browse my phone the rest of my journey. This is how a typical day in my life starts.<span id="more-310"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We live in a world where Information travels fast. The pace of life has increased quite appreciably. I wonder how<span style="line-height: 1.7;"> back in the day when a poor pigeon carrying your message, flies on a long journey to find its destination. How  much information could that bird carry, and how fast, Imagine a bird bringing you a message, you roll out the thick paper, written on it in a rustic handwriting it said: &#8220;The king likes your conquest, and the princess is now your follower&#8221;. Certainly, there was no time for trivialities back then, information was valuable and the speed at which the bird flew set the pace for that world.</span></p>
<blockquote class="alignright"><p>&#8220;we spend a sizable portion of our lives engaged in trivialities,</p>
<p>which prevents us from leading a peaceful life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jumping a few decades into the future, we are interrupted every waking moment of our lives by endless notifications and pop-ups. Notifications about your friend&#8217;s cat and how cute she is when she&#8217;s sleeping and another friend who&#8217;s eating a pizza (# biggest pizza ever). Out of 7 billion of us, 4.77 billion  have a mobile phone and that number keeps on growing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever I visit my grandparents in rural India. I find that there is a different pace of life there. There is more of a human connection. Everyone would sit together and talk about all things happening. Family members are interested to know more about my life and they sit down and listen to me when I talk. There is something different when you talk to your grandparents, they come from a different time. A time devoid of cell phones and digital content, Oh how I wish I had a time machine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s only my grandparents and older people who are not much affected by technology, I see toddlers playing with phones even when they are as old as three. Their tired mothers, in an effort to make them stop crying, put phones in front of them. The rich content of images, sounds, and videos captivate their brains. That is exactly what digital contents are designed to do. They work on a reward system, rewarding your brain with points and level ups, in an effort to keep you engaged.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;The true mark of a successful company is, to build habit-forming products&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our brains have gone from rewarding us for maintaining human connections to leveling-up in candy crush. That is a very sad shift in focus. We no longer actively seek out human connections anymore, not when we have access to thousands of application at our fingertips. Not only the mental shift, there is also a physiological change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The posture of our population is increasingly getting worse, and much to the benefit of chiropractors, almost everybody has back pain! It doesn&#8217;t stop there, Sleeplessness, Myopia, Depression, The list goes on. All these are insidious problems which affect the quality of our life, yet an addicted population is willing to go through all this suffering for the rewards they get.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our generation has the most number of mobile users, but thankfully we had a childhood before technology took over. I can&#8217;t imagine what the kids of today will grow up to be. who will they look up to? us? well, we are not setting an ideal example, are we? When the need for human connection is replaced in a kids brain by technological distractions, he will have a difficult time adjusting to people when he grows up. This leads to a secluded life and that is not a life worth cherishing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">we need to understand how addicted we really are and how our kids are the ones who are going to suffer,  bring a general awareness to this matter. We are in the matrix people! wake up! stop living your lives on autopilot. Go outside, sit on a bench and look at clouds and do nothing for a change. Feel the wind, the sun, the sound of the trees. You don&#8217;t have to talk to other people if you don&#8217;t want to, but it helps. Don&#8217;t work extra hard on your work just so you can go for an expensive &#8216;Tourist&#8217; vacation. You won&#8217;t feel any better when you&#8217;re there. Instead, focus on being in the moment. Take technology breaks whenever possible. In the end, our virtual lives are but mere facades, which masks our inner despair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Carpe Diem, Seize the day!</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-194" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d951.jpg" alt="3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d95" width="736" height="376" srcset="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d951.jpg 736w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/3f26d9aca50b61c4f767df77b8706d951-300x153.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" />A zombie is a person who is or appears lifeless, apathetic, or completely unresponsive to their surroundings. Sounds familiar right and they don&#8217;t just exist in the movies anymore. we see them everywhere, trains, colleges, coffee shops. And sadly for gamers and movie fanatics alike, the modern-day zombie invasion is much more insidious than one might imagine. There are less running and screaming and you don&#8217;t have to sacrifice your fat friend to escape, just a suggestion though.<span id="more-95"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">we live in a world where technology impacts every part of our lives, from communication to Fitness, we have given control of many of our daily activities over to technology,  it has replaced the need for physical or mental exertion. Our technology gets us off our beds, tells us how far we walked, and how far we have to walk in order to burn than pizza we just ate. My point is this, consumer technologies that are designed to help automate our lives are taking away our mental capacity. They are designed for the layman, you don&#8217;t have to think to use them; you know how  we used to drive cars with Manual transmissions, flash forward, we now have smart cars, Driver-less cars. It takes skill to drive a manual, a skill which has been replaced by driver aids, We are dumbing down the human race.</p>
<blockquote class="alignleft"><p>Use technology like Medication, not as vitamins.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember the old days when we remembered our friends birthdays and phone numbers, well those days have passed, and are now replaced by Instant Messaging and Social Media, where we live pseudo lives trying to impress random people and keeping up a pseudo social image. How we have degraded the necessity of the human connections. we spend so much of our waking hours online, we rarely get to live our lives anymore. It&#8217;s like dangling a carrot in front of the donkey, It doesn&#8217;t see anything else, cursed to ever walk towards the unattainable goal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The saddest part for me is how we have degraded the value of a simple Photograph. I&#8217;m a Photographer and I enjoy the finer details in one, the story, the lighting, the composition. A Photograph used to mean so much back then, It&#8217;s a slice of time we get to keep, a memory, a simple thing to look back on some day. And to think that this, which used to hold much value then, to be replaced by despicable Duck faces and Boob selfies. It saddens me to the core.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Epigenetics, the study of how external factors affect our genes, tells us that we are affecting the way our cells read our genes. we are leaving behind a legacy of self-destruction and isolation for our kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not to mention how our social and Moral values have shifted, Festivals and family hangouts which used to represent the importance human connections and social values, now become an isolated and distracted place. We do not see, what we have become.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174" src="https://minimalistsconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/albert.jpg" alt="albert" width="500" height="305" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Image Source: Google</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You see people being herded like sheep, people incessantly posting selfies to get attention. People being bombarded with information, which prevents them from thinking. We must strive to be better than that. we must become creators, not consumers, and for the few who can, we must show them a better way to live.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carpe diem, Seize the day!.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/download.png" alt="download" width="700" height="288" srcset="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/download.png 700w, http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/download-300x123.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently I read about a captive lion reintroduction program called &#8216;Walking with Lions&#8217;. The project focuses on releasing captive born African lions into the wild after supposedly training them to adapt to their natural setting. They have a system where the release is conducted in phases like reintroduction, rehabilitation etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It sounds good on paper, but in reality it is not practical. The more we intervene with the way of life of these animals the more we destroy their natural instincts. These centers are Advertised as &#8216;wildlife encounters&#8217; programs and typically charge tourists and paying volunteers to pet, feed and walk with hand-raised and so-called tame lions.<span id="more-28"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The word &#8216;Educated&#8217; in this context describes a &#8216;Trained&#8217; Lion. The way humans want them. we have a similar situation happening in our everyday lives, our children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The way we treat our children is similar to the way we treat lions, we try to control them, tell them what to do, follow what is told without question. These might work for toddlers but imagine as a kid spending his first twenty years of his life in a system like this, he has lost most of his natural gifts and is now nothing more than a person who does what is being told.</p>
<blockquote class="alignleft"><p>&#8220;The greatest Irony in our education system is that kids are taught to obey orders,  and when they graduate, they are expected to be free thinkers, creating their own paths in life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The most difficult time arises when they comes out of the system and starts interacting with the real world, like finding a job. Similar to the way lion cubs behave when released to the wild after being born in captivity, they wait for someone to tell them what to do. All their life they have been taught to obey orders. But now there is no one to give them an order, they have to find their own way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s striking how most of  the successful people in the world are self-made men. They did not rely on any system to show them the path. They made their own. &#8220;They are the Lions of the Concrete Jungle&#8221;. They did not succumb to the common notion of education. They were the rebels, and now millions of people who followed the system depend on these rebel for their living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us rise above this common notion of education and learn to think for ourselves, let us not disparage our children&#8217;s efforts nor point them away from their dreams. Let us come together and set them free. For no way is the right way, every way is different for each person.</p>
