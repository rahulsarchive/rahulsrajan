				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good introduction to personal finance and ways of thinking about money. Kiyosaki introduces the concept of the difference between Assets and Liabilities and how the rich acquire assets, while the poor and middle class acquires liabilities which they think are assets. He explains about the Rat Race and how people fall on this hedonic treadmill where things are never enough. He doesn&#8217;t give any direct methods for achieving financial freedom, just some principle to keep in mind. A quick read and one that will get you started in thinking about personal finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peoples lives are forever controlled by two emotions, Fear and Greed. Offer them more money and they continue the cycle by increasing their spending.</p>
<p>Rule #1 Know the difference between an asset and a liability</p>
<ul>
<li>An asset puts money in your pocket every month and a liability takes money out of it.</li>
<li>People work hard &gt; Income increases &gt; expenses increases</li>
<li>Most end up in making a decision to own a house rather than start an investment portfolio.</li>
<li>Investing in a house results in
<ul>
<li>loss of time, during which other assets could have increased in value.</li>
<li>loss of capital which could have been invested instead of paying for high maintenance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Wealth is s person&#8217;s ability ot survive so many number of days forward, or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?</p></blockquote>
<p>Rule #3 Mind your own business</p>
<p>The rich focus on their asset column while everyone else focuses on their income statement.</p>
<p>Eg- McDonald&#8217;s is not a hamburger business but a real estate one.</p>
<p>The mistake in becoming what you study is that too many people forget to mind their own business. They spend their lives minding someone else&#8217;s business and making that person rich. Your business revolves around your asset column, not your income.</p>
<p>Start minding your own business. Keep your day-time job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home.</p>
<p>Rich people build their asset column first and the income generated from the assets pays for their luxuries.</p>
<p>A government bureaucrat gets paid to spend money and hire people. The more he spends the more people he hires, the larger his organisation becomes. In the government, a large organization is a respected organisation.</p>
<p>The government ideal is to avoid having excess money, if you fail to spend the allotted funds, you risk losing it in the next budget. You would not be recognized for being efficient. On the other hand business, people are rewarded for having excess money and applauded for their efficiency.</p>
<p>A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body with no soul. It was popular because the income tax rate of a corporation is less than the individual income tax rate. And certain expenses could be paid by the corporation with pre-tax dollars.</p>
<p>Knowledge is power, with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply. Without that knowledge the world pushes you around.</p>
<p>Financial IQ is made up of knowledge in four areas of expertise</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounting</li>
<li>Investing</li>
<li>Understanding Markets</li>
<li>The Law</li>
</ul>
<p>Tax advantage &#8211; A corporation can pay expenses before paying taxes.</p>
<p>A corporation earns, spends everything it can and is taxed on anything that is left. Its one of the biggest tax loopholes. Eg- by owning your corporation, your vacation can be a board meeting in Hawaii. But its done legally with pre-tax dollars.</p>
<p>The rich hide much of their wealth using vehicles like corporation and trusts to protect them from creditors. when someone sues a wealthy individual they are often met with layers of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person owns nothing. They control everything but own nothing. The poor and middle class try to own everything and lose it to government or to fellow citizens who like to sue the rich.</p>
<blockquote><p>Often in the real world it is not the smartes who get ahead, but the bold</p></blockquote>
<p>The hardest part of running a company is managing people. Leadership is what you need to learn, If you are not a good leader, you will get shot in the back, just like they do in business.</p>
<p>The primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear.</p>
<p>If you have little money and you want to be rich, you must first be focused not balanced.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t afford it&#8221;shuts down your brain. &#8220;How can I afford it?&#8221; opens up possibilities and excitement.</p>
<p>Do what you feel in your heart to be right, for you&#8217;ll be criticized anyway. You&#8217;ll be damned if you do and damned if you don&#8217;t.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our culture has educated into believing that the love for money is the root of all evil. It encouraged us to learn a profession so that we can work for money but failed to teach us how money can work for us. It taught us not to worry about our financial future because our company of the government would take care of us when our working days are over.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the hardest things about wealth building is to be true to yourself and to be willing to not go along with the crowd. Its because in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late that is slaughtered. If a great deal is on the front page, then it&#8217;s already too late in most instances, look for a new deal.</p>
<p>Many middle managers remain, middle managers, failing to get promoted, because they know how to manage people under them, but not with people above them.</p>
<p>Move a sizable amount of money into a stock of a company that is about to release a product, that will add value to the stock, move your money in for a week to a month, and when the stock goes up, pull the initial amount out and stop worrying about fluctuations of the market, money goes in, money goes out, and you own an asset which was technically free.</p>
<p>Make lots of offers, people who are investors have no idea what it feels like to try and sell something. Always make offers with an escape clause. In real estate, make offers with language that details &#8220;Subject to&#8221;contingencies, such as the approval of a business partner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Profits are made in buying not in selling.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Three Income</p>
<ul>
<li>Ordinary Income &#8211; earned income, taxed the most</li>
<li>Portfolio Income &#8211; income derived from paper assets such as stocks and bonds</li>
<li>Passive Income &#8211; income most derived from real estate.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Risk comes from not knowing what you are doing &#8211; Warren Buffet</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A book about the psychology of what motivates people. It talks about how to inspire intrinsic motivation and how external rewards are detrimental to our behaviour.</p>
<p>Favourite quote-</p>
<blockquote><p>Being a professional, is doing the  things you love to do, on the days you don&#8217;t feel like doing them.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p><strong>The Tom swayer Effect</strong> &#8211; Rewards can perform a weird sort of behavioural alchemy: They can transform an interesting task into a drudge.</p>
<p>People use rewards expecting to gain the benefit of increasing another person&#8217;s motivation and behaviour, but in doing so, they often incur the unintentional and hidden cost of undermining the person&#8217;s intrinsic motivation towards the activity.</p>
<p><strong>The Principle Agent Theory</strong> &#8211; Rewards are addictive in that once offered, a contingent reward makes an agent expect it whenever a similar task is faced, which in turn compels the principal to use rewards over and over again.</p>
<p>Eg- pay your son to take out the trash and he will never do it for free, once the initial money buzz tapers off, you&#8217;ll likely have to increase the payment to continue compliance.</p>
<p>The very presence of goals may lead employees to focus myopically on short term gains and to lose sight of the potential devastating long term effects on the organization.</p>
<p>The approach for a rotuine task,</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a rationale for why the task is necessary.</li>
<li>Acknowledge that the task is boring.</li>
<li>Allow people to complete the task their own way (Autonomy).</li>
</ul>
<p>Any extrinsic reward should be unexpected and the only offered after the task is complete.</p>
<p>A better solution,</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider non-tangible rewards, praise and positive feedback are much less corrosive that cash and trophies.</li>
<li>Provide useful information, the more feedback focuses on specifics and more the praise is about the effort and strategy, rather than about achieving a  particular goal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Self Determination theory</strong> &#8211; We have 3 innate psycological needs- <strong>competence, autonomy, relatedness</strong>. When these needs are satisfied, we are motivated, productive and happy.</p>
<p>One source of frustration in the workplace is the frequent mismatch of what people must do and what people can do.</p>
<p><strong>Mundanity of Excellence</strong> &#8211; Those who did the best typically spend the most time and effort on the mundane activites that readied them for the races.</p>
<p>Between the words businesses use and the goals they seek, sit the policies they implement to turn the former into the latter.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the first books I read in the self-help category, it helped me find a genre of books that I really love. The content is thought-provoking, a good starting point into entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>My Notes</h3>
<blockquote><p>Leadership is defined as creating a future for others which would not have happened otherwise &#8211; Bryan Franklin</p></blockquote>
<p>For fifty thousand years, humans did what they were passionate about, and then they did something else to eat. I don&#8217;t think there is anything written down that says those days are gone forever.</p>
<blockquote><p>People have this idea that either you&#8217;re a cog in the machine, just working for the man, or youré out singing on stage, making your living that way It seems like there is a lot in between.</p></blockquote>
<p>The very best thing you can do when starting a business is to keep your overheads as low as possible and make sure you are getting recurring revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Iteration Velocity</strong> &#8211; When creating a new offering, your primary goal should be to work through each iteration cycle as quickly as possible. An iteration is a structured form of learning that helps you make your offering better. The faster you learn the more quickly you improve.</p>
<blockquote><p>The ardent or insane pursuit of a goal is a good idea if the steps you take along the way prep you for other outcome s each almost as good (or better). If bending the market to your will and shipping on time and doing important and scary work are all things you need to develop along the way, then it really doesn&#8217;t matter much if you don&#8217;t make the goal you set out to reach &#8211; Seth Godin</p></blockquote>
<p>The amount of money you earn is the measure of the value that others place on your contribution.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can have anything you want in life, if you will just help other people get what they want &#8211; Zig Ziglar</p></blockquote>
<p>If you can get people who don&#8217;t know about you to know about you (marketing) and you can convert them into customers (sales) and once they&#8217;re customers, you can lead them from point A to point B, you can accomplish anything on the planet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sell them what they want and give them what they need &#8211; Eben pagan</p></blockquote>
<p>If you try to sell a solution before you&#8217;ve muttually agreed on the problem &#8211; which most salespeople do &#8211; People are mostly not interested.</p>
<p>The essence of building your own brand, people having heard of you &#8211; and having a positive impression &#8211; before you&#8217;ve even met them. If you can create that, doors open for you.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial mindset &#8211; Always look for the highest leverage thing that could be accomplished, and then get it done. Never wait for permission or instructions to make things better.</p>
<p>A reasonable man adapts to his environment. An unreasonable man persists in attempting to adapt his environment to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</p>
<p>A startup needs to learn about the problem, the solution, who the customers are, and getting all these pieces to fit together. An early stage startup is a set of assumptions and you need to test those assumptions systematically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me something that you think is true that very few people agree with.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most influential books I have read on psychology. The book details all the methods used by marketers to capture our attention and to persuade our actions. This can be something as small as laughter tracks in comedy sitcoms or more profound like influencing the actions of POWs in Chinese prison camps. All in all, a good read.</p>
<p>Favourite quote &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>With the sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in that fashion of the animals that we long ago transcended.</p></blockquote>
<h3>My notes</h3>
<h3>1. Weapons of Influence</h3>
<p>When we ask people for a favour, we will be more successful if we provide them with a reason.</p>
<p>Contrast principle &#8211; When two things are presented one after the other, if the second item is fairly different than the first, then we will perceive it to be more different. Eg- Next to an expensive item a less costly one will seem cheaper.</p>
<blockquote><p>Civilization advances by extending the number of operation we can perform without thinking about them &#8211; Alfred North Whitehead.</p></blockquote>
<h3>2. Reciprocation</h3>
<blockquote><p>Pay every debt, as if God write the bill. &#8211; Ralph Walds Emerson</p></blockquote>
<p>We are humans because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honoured network of obligations</p>
<p><strong>Rejection then Retreat technique</strong> &#8211; One way to increase your chance would be to first make a larger request that the other person will reject then you would make a smaller offer that you were interested in all along, provided you have structured your request skillfully.</p>
<h3>3. Commitment and Consistency</h3>
<p>Once we have made a choice or taken a stand, we will encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.</p>
<p>Commitment is strongest when it is public.</p>
<p><strong>Give it and take it away strategy</strong> &#8211; An advantage is offered that induces a favourable purchase decision then, sometime after the decision has been made but before the bargain is sealed, the original price advantage is deftly removed. A way to solve it &#8211;  ask yourself, &#8221; Knowing what I know now, if I could go back in time, would I make the same choice again.&#8221;</p>
<h3>4. Social Proof</h3>
<blockquote><p>Where all think alike, no one thinks very much &#8211; Walter Lippmann</p></blockquote>
<p>We view a behaviour as more correct in a given situation to the degree that we see others performing it.</p>
<p>Pluralistic ignorance &#8211; In which each person decided that since nobody is concerned, nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>Werther Effect &#8211; immediately after following a front page suicide story the suicide rate increase dramatically in those geographical areas where the story has been highly publicized.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 95% of the people are imitators and only 5% initiators, people are persuaded more by the actions of others thatn by any proof we can offer &#8211; Cavett Robert</p></blockquote>
<p>No leader can hope to persuade, regularly and single-handedly, all the members of the group. Thus the most influential leaders are those who know how to arrange group conditions to allow the principle of social proof to work maximally in their favour.</p>
<p>Social proof is most powerful for those who feel unfamiliar with their surroundings and must consequently look outwards for evidence on how to behave.</p>
<h3>5. Liking</h3>
<blockquote>
<div>The main work of a trial attorney is to make a jury like his client &#8211; Clarence Darrow</div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<p><strong>Halo Effect</strong> &#8211; One positive character of a person dominates the way that person is viewed by others. Eg- Attractiveness.</p>
<p><strong>The Good Cop/ Bad Cop</strong> &#8211;  The main reason it works is that it gives the impression that someone is on our side.</p>
<p>Our vigilance should be directed towards the fact that undue liking has been generated. The biggest mistakes come when we are fond of the person making that request.</p>
<h3>6. Authority</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Milgram Experiment</strong> &#8211; &#8216;When it is their job, how much suffering will ordinary people be willing to inflict on an entirely innocent person.&#8217; It has to do with a deep-seated sense of duty to authority. The real culprit was the subjects inability to defy the wishes of his boss.</p>
<p>When confronted with an authority figure&#8217;s influence, think &#8221; is this authority truly an expert&#8221; and the credentials and the relevance of them to the topic at hand.</p>
<p>They might seem to argue with themselves a bit, a good strategy for proving their honesty. Eg- &#8220;Loreal&#8217;s a bit more expensive and worth it&#8221;.</p>
<h3>7. Scarcity</h3>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div>The way to love anything is to know that it might be lost &#8211; G.K Chesterton</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of potential loss plays a larger value into human decision making. People seem to be more motivated by the thought of losing something than by the thought of gaining something of equal value.</p>
<blockquote><p>The joy is not in experiencing a scarce commodity, but in possessing it. It is important that we not confuse the two.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p><strong>The Romeo and Juliet effect</strong>&#8211; The boomerang quality of parental pressure on adolescent behaviour.  Couples suffering from parental interference react by committing themselves more firmly to the partnership.</p>
<p>Only individuals whose freedom in the matter had not been restricted by the law had the inclination to live by it.</p>
<p>For political groups, the most effective strategy is not to publicize their unpopular views, but to get them officially censored and then publish the censorship. It is not that the audience members want to have that information more, it is that they tend to believe in it.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons for rulers</strong> &#8211; When it comes to freedom, it is more dangerous to have given for a while than never to have given at all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Dogs might be Man&#8217;s best friends, but books are a close second. There is something magical about holding a book in your hands, it slows your thought and allows your brain to absorb knowledge. Our phones are always up to date but, we never think of updating ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the right books, you can learn anything on your own, no subject is out of your reach. The time has come. Break free from the Highschool mentality and start learning in the real world. Read more, not just fiction, but books that fundamentally change your perspective, books which split your life to a Before Book (BB) and an After Book (AB).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;re a few of my personal favorites, you can start with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2636"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2dREQld">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a>, by Robert B Cialdini</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2dREQld"><img class="alignleft" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512-B-1yXuL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Influence Psychology of persuation" width="151" height="227" /></a>Humans are emotional beings, with the right stimulus, we are easily influenced. This book is a classic, and The best book on Influencing humans ever written. Robert Cialdini unravels the simple reasons of &#8216;Why we do-What we do&#8217; <strong>When you get down to it, We humans are nothing but animals with iPhones.</strong> The majority of our actions are influenced by our emotions. We may not be as rational as we think we are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a marketer, you need to read this book. You understand The power Authority holds over us, How to get people to like a brand by the power of Social proof, and even the infamous &#8216;Good Cop/ Bad Cop&#8217; routine.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With the sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so complex, fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended.”</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2MOZ1">On writing well</a>, by William Zinsser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2MOZ1"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EBnx45BBL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="On Writing well, William Zinsser" width="155" height="233" /></a>This book forms the core of my writing. Anyone who takes writing seriously should read this book. William Zinsser lays down the foundation for going from, good to a great writer. He taught me that writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. The secret, he says, to good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components, clear thinking becomes clear writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Writers don&#8217;t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the one who sat down to write it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Writing is an act of Ego, you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep you going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are writing for yourself. Dont try to visualize the great mass audience, every reader is different. Editors and readers dont know what they want to read until they have read it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2eiaAiO">Rich Dad poor Dad</a> &#8211; Robert </strong>Kiyosaki</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2eiaAiO"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yyzvo-TOL.jpg" alt="Rich dad poor dad" width="160" height="262" /></a>If you are a recent college graduate or in your first job and know nothing about personal finance, you need this book. Robert Kiyosaki lays the ground rules, the fundamentals of how to get rich and stay rich. The rules that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. How taxes were first implemented for the rich and then trickled downwards. He explains the need for Financial IQ, to be able to read numbers (Accounting) and understand them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rule#1 know the difference between an Asset and a Liability and buy Assests. An Asset puts money in your pocket every month, and A liability takes money out of your pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;our culture has educated us into beleving that the love for money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so that we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry about our fiantial fututre because our company or the government would take care of us when our working days are over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key to becoming welthy is the ability to convert ordianry income into passive or portfolio income as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2Zzmh">Everybody writes</a>, by Ann </strong>Hadley</h2>

alt="Everybody writes" width="184" height="274" />One of my favorite books on writing in the modern age. This book is like batman&#8217;s utility belt. It has everything you need to fight crime (optional). It combines the rules for writing good English with all the tools and knowledge required by the modern writer. Hadley taught me to embrace my ugly first draft and not let the tyranny of the finished product stop me from writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Story telling as it applies to businees isint about spinng a yarn or a fairly tail. Rather its about how your business exist in the real world: Who you are and what you do for the benefit of others, and how you add value to peoples lives.</p>
<p>A Compelleing brand story is kind of a gift that gives your audience a way to connect with you as  a person to another and to view your business as whatt it is; a living, breathing entity run by real people offering real value.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shockproof, Shit detector.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Written in a time long forgotten, the rules still apply even today. Everyone should read this book at least once. I often wonder why this book is not taught in school. Kids need to learn these fundamental life skills instead of those useless complex differential equations. This book has helped me a lot when it comes to dealing with people, I&#8217;m always polite and never get mad easily—a trait I got from this book.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Say to yourself over and over: “My popularity, my happiness, and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Action spring out of what we fundamentally desire&#8230;and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in schools, or in politics, is: <strong>First, arouse in the other person an eager want.</strong> He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walk a lonely way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You will be the same today and in five years, except for the people you meet, and the books you read&#8221;</p></blockquote>
