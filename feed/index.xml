				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In April this year, I got selected to become part of Kerala Startup Mission&#8217;s Technology Innovation Fellowship program (TIFP). Out of many who applied, twenty were selected from across Kerala.</p>
<p>We were the Third bath of fellows to join startup mission, since its inception. I applied for the program as I wanted to learn more about the startup ecosystem and to be around like-minded people. The opportunity that was before me was enormous.</p>
<p>When I tell people what my job at KSUM is, most of them have difficulty understanding it. In some ways, our jobs may be under defined, it&#8217;s not like a regular 9-5 job. But if I were to boil it down, my job would be to <strong>connect people</strong>. We are the liaison to the Government.</p>
<p>We joined on the 24th April for our week long induction program. The program was set to orient us in the direction KSUM was heading. We had talk sessions with a lot of people from varied backgrounds and also visited IEDCs in various colleges across Kerala. What follows is an account of the things I have learned from my interactions and the challenges we face in creating a Startup Ecosystem.</p>
<h4>1. We can ease up on Evangelisation of Entrepreneurship.</h4>
<p>Thanks to a lot of media coverage and sites like YourStory, most students have some idea what Entrepreneurship is. Now our main focus is not to spread the idea of startups but to try and bring as many people from the startup world together so that they can interact among themselves and share their knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>What the students need is a role model, someone they can look up to, someone they can relate with. They want to see that an ordinary guy like them can get into the startup world and be successful. Examples like  Facebook and Apple have become cliched, and students can&#8217;t relate to them. We need stories of ordinary people like you and me, who are running their companies. We want to know what drives them, and what keeps them up at night.</p>
<p>Stories inspire people, and interactions help them relate to that person. Our aim as fellows would be to use our reach and bring together as many people as we can find in the startup ecosystem. We will accomplish this through, conferences, talk sessions, webinars and all means necessary.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship has become a common word in our society these days, but few people really know what it means. <strong> Entrepreneurship is not about starting some unicorn company and moving to America. It&#8217;s about solving real world problems and making people&#8217;s lives better.</strong><span id="more-2792"></span></p>
<h4>2. How to follow up on Programs/Workshops</h4>
<p>We talked with a lot of IEDC nodal officers in many colleges across the state—and in some form or the other—I heard this common concern. There is no follow up on programs/workshops conducted for students. This seems to be a core problem. We can conduct as many workshops as we like, but if the students don&#8217;t follow up them, then is would all be for nothing.</p>
<p>Usually what happens is that the students participate in some Workshop/ Hackathons and over the course of the programme, they learn something about a new technology. But once it&#8217;s over, very few people follow-up on what they learn. <strong>Most of the programmes conducted for students have no follow-up mechanism.</strong></p>
<p>In some cases, <strong>students come for certificates which they can put on their resumes</strong>, It&#8217;s really sad. This, I fear is the institutionalised mindset, that has been ingrained into students. That, whatever you do as a student, is to get a job in some good company.</p>
<p>Our challenge would be to break this tradition, put some more effort into creating programmes for students, which has some kind of follow-up mechanism. One or two-day workshops are good for spreading awareness, but they are not what we need in the long run.</p>
<p>We need a systematic programme, that addresses an individual&#8217;s needs and follows up on their work. Sounds a lot like a school doesn&#8217;t it? Which brings me to my next point.</p>
<h4>3. How to bring the spirit of Entrepreneurship into <del>the curriculum</del> Children&#8217;s lives.</h4>
<p>I read in a book that,  our educational system — in its entirety — was designed over a century ago to turn out educated and compliant factory workers. The more I look around, the more it seems to be true. There are certain things that our school system is good for, like teaching discipline, encouraging competition etc.</p>
<p>But our educational system has struggled to keep up with the changes in time. As any Darwinian would agree, It is not the fittest that survive, but the one most adaptable to change. Our educational system has a lot of inertia. It has been rolling for quite some time that, we cannot easily stop it or change its direction.</p>
<p>Taking that into consideration, what we want to do it is augment it. Slowly build a new system on top of the existing one until it completely replaces it. Easy to say, but very hard to do.</p>
<p>This point came across when we were talking with the previous batch of fellows. Our aim is not to make everyone start their own company. It might sound like a noble quest, but not an ideal one. <strong>Our aim is to make students ready to enter the startup ecosystem</strong>. What does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>To enter into the corporate world, you need qualifications, but to enter the startup world, you need Skills</strong>. This is where it all boils down to. Students need skills. I doubt that many colleges provide students with skills they need to survive in the current economy. This should be our primary focus for now.</p>
<p>Students can learn their college curriculum, but they should also be given time to explore, to try different things and pick up new skills. So the question is how do we do that? How do we give enough time for students to pursue such skills, while still going through the rigours of formal education?</p>
<p>One answer would be to create an environment of competition. From my experience, I can tell that the students who take part in Workshops/Hackathons work really hard to win. They learn new things and learn to apply them to solve a problem. This is something we can tap into.</p>
<p>Kids are naturally curious, I love it when I talk with them, you can feel their potential for growth. All it takes is the right environment. I&#8217;m suggesting a method where we give real world problems as challenges to students and ask them to solve it. We will extend to them the resources they need.</p>
<p><strong>The point is to make the kids become problem solvers</strong>. Once a person goes through such a task, he/she will be well equipped to handle more problems in the future.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on a method to implement this idea, where we give the governments problems as challenges to students. We will post these challenges for people to solve, and the best ideas to come forward will be given the support they need to implement it. I know there will be a lot of bureaucratic processes to get through before it gets implemented. I feel our government should be more open about its problems, lest they fear that it might be used against them.</p>
<h4>4. How to Spread the knowledge of Digital Fabrication</h4>
<p>Kerala startup mission has signed an MOU with MIT&#8217;s  Center for Bits and Atoms, USA. With their help, KSUM has set up two Fablabs in the state. One in Technopark, Trivandrum and other in KTIZ, Kochi.</p>
<p>Fablabs are a technical prototyping platform that share core capabilities so that people and projects can be shared across them. They started as an outreach programme by MIT and have grown to over 1600 labs around the world. They serve as places where people can go and prototype their ideas and create their own technology.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Fablabs enable you to do now, that which the personal fabricators of tomorrow can do in the future&#8221; — Neil Greshenfeld, Drirector of Center for Bits and Atoms.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have written a previous article explaining what are fablabs and what you can do with them <a href="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/2017/03/04/mits-fablab-and-kerala-startup-mission/">HERE</a>.</p>
<p>I have been undergoing the fabacademy course for the past 5 months and I have learned a lot from the experience, plus I also got to make some pretty cool stuff along the way. The main thing that I have felt while going through fabacademy is a change in my perspective. No longer am I bound to the — one size fits all — commercial products. I can design and build almost anything. It is truly a great feeling, and you get a certain sense of accomplishment when you create something from scratch. But not many people know of this awesome opportunity they have, and I want to change that.</p>
<p>Our current focus is to bring the art of digital fabrication into Engineering colleges. We are in the process of setting up 20 Mini Fablabs in colleges across the state. They will have the same functionality as ordinary fablabs but in a smaller format. There is also a plan to conduct the fabacademy course as a two-year programme for colleges students. This I believe is a good initiative. Now students get to learn how to apply what they have learned in their curriculum. but still, a challenge remains. How to get students from Arts and Science background interested in Digital Fabrication?</p>
<p>This challenge requires a bit more research to find a suitable method in which we can approach the problem. Fablabs are not just for engineers, it also a place where Artists can come and work as well. Few people know what fablabs are capable of and I intend to change that.</p>
<h4>5. How to bring it all together? The Startup Ecosystem</h4>
<p>KSUM already has a lot of great initiatives like Learning to code, Startup Bootcamp etc. But what we are aiming for is the formation of a startup ecosystem in Kerala. This is our mission. We need to bring together these independent events and make them part of an ecosystem.</p>
<p>Why do we need an ecosystem? It&#8217;s because of a simple index that India lags in, The Ease of Doing Business. We rank 130 on that list. India is a tough economy for starting your business and <strong>our aim through the formation of an ecosystem is to reduce the barrier for entry of people into the startup world.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure a lot of smaller communities are present now, so the challenge would be how to bring them all together? This will be something we will be working on quite a lot.</p>
<h4>Epilogue</h4>
<p>It is no longer enough that people know about Entrepreneurship, they must be shown a way to it. We need to bring about more interaction between the people inside the startup community and the ones outside. These interactions will help People find role models they can relate with.</p>
<p>Workshops/Hackathons are good for bringing awareness but focus must be given to creating a follow-up mechanism for these kinds of programs for students.</p>
<p>Our aim is not to make everyone start their own company, it is to make them ready to enter the startup ecosystem. To enter into the corporate world, you need qualifications, but to enter the startup world, you need Skills. Hence we need to bring more skill-based programs for students in colleges. We can do that by providing a challenging environment for students so that they can work on improving their skills.</p>
<p>I suggest a way by which, we should let students bring solutions to the government&#8217;s problems. Give them challenges to work on and provide them with support, stand back and be surprised.</p>
<p>Digital Fabrication is an art, that can be learned by anyone. I want people to embrace this opportunity and learn to be creators. Be the makers of your own technology. If what you build is good, build them for others as well.</p>
<p>The creation of a startup ecosystem will be the culmination of our efforts. We will work to bring together men and machines to make that happen.</p>
<p>This, I believe is the way forward.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m open to suggestions on all that I have shared. I want as many minds to work on this as possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m grateful to be a part of KSUM&#8217;s activities and I hope to accomplish many things. You can reach out to me anytime.</p>

<h3>What are Fab labs?</h3>
<p>Fab labs are a technical prototyping platform, where people can design and build their own technology. Fab labs or Fabrication Laboratories began as an outreach project from MIT&#8217;s Center for Bits and Atoms (CBA) headed by Neil Gershenfeld.</p>
<p>Fab labs are designed in a way that people with minimal training can come and work on developing their own technology for personal or commercial use. They comprise of roughly fifty thousand dollars in equipment and materials that can be used to make almost anything. They share core capabilities so that people and projects can be shared across them. This currently includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A</strong> <strong>computer-controlled laser cutter</strong>, for press-fit assembly of 3D structures from 2D parts</li>
<li><strong>A larger (4&#8217;x8&#8242;) numerically-controlled milling machine</strong>, for making furniture- (and house) sized parts</li>
<li><strong>A sign cutter, to produce printing masks</strong>, flexible circuits, and antennas</li>
<li><strong>A precision (micron resolution) milling machine</strong> to make three-dimensional molds and surface-mount circuit boards</li>
<li><strong>Programming tools</strong> for low-cost high-speed embedded processors</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-2762"></span></p>
<p>This inventory is continuously evolving, towards the goal of a fab lab being able to make a fab lab. The Fab Lab comprises of off-the-shelf, industrial-grade fabrication and electronics tools wrapped in open source software and programmes written by researchers at the MIT.</p>
<p>More than just a prototyping platform, a Fab Lab connects to a global community of learners, educators, technologists, researchers, makers, and innovators &#8211; a knowledge sharing network that spans 30 countries and 24 time zones.</p>
<p>And because all Fab Labs share common tools and processes, the programme is building a global network, a distributed laboratory for research and innovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There has been a digital revolution in communication. Now it is time for a digital revolution in fabrication, where data is turned into products,” — Neil Gershenfeld</p></blockquote>
<p>Usually, entrepreneurs and innovators will have to go to several facilities to produce different parts of their products, like circuit boards, and packaging etc. Fab Labs are designed to provide these facilities in a single place. Thus it enables an entrepreneur to develop a prototype of the actual product and display it to the market and to other stakeholders.</p>
<h3>Kerala Startup mission and MIT Fab labs</h3>
<p>On June 16, 2015, Neil Greshenfeld, Director of Centre for Bits and Atoms, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), arrived in Thiruvananthapuram and met with Chief Minister Oommen Chandy to discuss the details of two Fab Labs being set up in the State.</p>
<p>The Fab lab programme involves setting up state-of-the-art Fabrication laboratories in the state to encourage startups in the technology sector.</p>
<p>With the support of Government of Kerala, Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) has started two MIT Electronics Fabrication labs each at Technopark, Trivandrum and Kerala Technology Innovation Zone (KTIZ), Kochi. The Fab lab in Technopark, Trivandrum is established inside the campus of Indian Institute of Technology and Management- Kerala (IIITM-K).</p>
<h3>Fab Lab Trivandrum</h3>
<p>It is located in the IITMK campus inside Technopark. Technopark has all the infrastructure for making software based innovation, this is a much-needed addition. Fablabs adds Rapid Hardware Prototyping facilities, which will enable more startups to explore technology-based innovations.</p>
<h3>Hardware Prototyping Capabilities of Fab lab Trivandrum</h3>
<h3>Computer controlled Machines</h3>
<h4>Trotec Speedy 100 (Laser Cutting/Engraving)</h4>
<p><img class="size-medium_large wp-image-2765 alignnone" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3986-768x512.jpg" alt="Fablab kerala Troctec laser Cutter" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3986-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3986-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3986-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3986-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>In our lab, we have a <strong>60w carbon dioxide lase</strong>r capable of cutting Cardboard, Wood, Acrylic etc. This is a precise machine which is very versatile. You can make a multitude of different structures from engraving your photo or logo on wood, to cutting out press fit assemblies which can be put together to form 3D structures. The process is very quick, and the software is easy to use. All you need is a <strong>vector image</strong> of the item you want to engrave or cut. You can load it to any <strong>vector based software</strong> like <strong>Inkscape, Illustrator</strong> and print it out. The laser works on the basis of colour, we can set some predefined colours on the software and define power and speed settings for it so that we can either engrave or cut depending on the colour we set. In our lab, we set the <strong>Red </strong>to cut and <strong>Black</strong> to engrave.</p>
<h3>Shopbot Large Scale CNC Mill (Wood Carving/Cutting)</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium_large wp-image-2766" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3990-768x512.jpg" alt="Fablab Kerala Shopbot" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3990-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3990-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3990-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3990-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> <img class="alignnone size-medium_large wp-image-2767" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3995-768x512.jpg" alt="Fablab Kerala Shopbot" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3995-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3995-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3995-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_3995-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We have the industry standard <strong>Shopbot Large scale CNC Mill</strong>, which you can find in any fab lab across the globe. This is a pretty cool machine and because of its large format, it can be used to make anything from 3D carving of wood to Press fit furniture and even an entire house. The functioning is like the laser cutter and It needs a <strong>DXF </strong>file format which contains the path you want the tool to follow.</p>
<h3>High Resolution Mini NC Mill: Modela (PCB production)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium_large" src="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabtrivandrum/students/280/assets/img/week4/modella/modella.jpg" alt="Fab lab Kerala Modella Milling machine" width="1280" height="720" /></p>
<p>Modella is used for milling Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). This is a high precision machine with micron resolution. It can mill out a single-sided board. It takes its input from a PNG image of the circuit traces and the software turns them into tool paths for the bit to follow.</p>
<h3>Vinyl Plotter (Flexible Circuits, Vinyl signs, Vinyl Masks)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium_large wp-image-2770" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4023-768x512.jpg" alt="Fablab Kerala Vinyl plotter" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4023-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4023-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4023-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4023-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We have a <strong>Roland MDX 20</strong> Desktop Vinyl Plotter. It is a simple, yet versatile machine. It has a knife which is moved across a sheet of Vinyl to cut it. The Input to this machine comes from a <strong>PNG </strong>image file. This can be your Company logo, PCB design, Silkscreen mask. The software converts the image into tool paths and the machine will cut out the vinyl.</p>
<h3>Dimension and Ultimaker 2 (3D Printing)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabtrivandrum/students/280/assets/img/week5/3dprint/hardware.JPG" alt="Fablab Kerala 3D printer" width="442" height="664" /></p>
<p>We have two 3D printers in our lab, <strong>Dimension,</strong> and <strong>Ultimaker2. </strong>Dimension is a very high-end 3D printer capable of Printing ABS plastic. It can 3D print complex part assemblies because of the way it handles support material. That means you can 3D print a working Gearbox assembly for your product in one go. The Ultimaker2 is a much more Hobby grade 3D printer. Suitable for prototyping sample designs. It has good dimensional accuracy and very goos print quality. For 3D printing, you need an <strong>STL</strong> file of your 3D part.</p>
<h3>Manual Machines</h3>
<h3>Vulcan Furnace</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium_large wp-image-2769" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4000-768x512.jpg" alt="Fablab Kerala Vulcan Furnace" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4000-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4000-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4000-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/IMG_4000-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We use the Vulcan Furnace for Melting and Casting Metal. We make silicon molds using any other manufacturing method and then melt the metal in the furnace and pour it into the mold.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fabacademy</a> conducts a course on <strong>Digital fabrication</strong> every year. Many labs from across the world host this course and students from many countries participate in them. The Fab Academy is a fast-paced, hands-on learning experience where students plan and execute a new project each week. Each individual documents their progress for each project, resulting in a personal portfolio of technical accomplishments.</p>
<p>I joined the <a href="http://fabacademy.org/">Fabacademy</a> Course in January this year, we are the 13th batch of students in the fabacademy. My experience so far has been awesome. You get to learn a lot of stuff in such a short amount of time. Every week we are working on something new. The machines are awesome to work with and the assignments are challenging. This unlike any course I have gone through, The pace is fast, we have one week to learn about the software, hardware, and design and make our assignments. This course is challenging and the rewards are high. You can see my progress on my <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabtrivandrum/students/280/index.html">Fabacademy Archive page</a>.</p>

<p>You may not realize it but you are already a writer. We write every day from Emails and chats to work related reports. We might not be paying much attention to how we write them, but these words represent who we are.</p>
<p>What you write is often the only chance you&#8217;ll get to present yourself to someone whose business or money or good will you need. If you write with broken English and cluttered sentences, you won&#8217;t be leaving a good impression. This does not imply that you use pompous words and extravagant adjectives to make you seem important—the corporate mindset—Writing clear sentences should be the aim.<span id="more-2656"></span></p>
<h2>Why become a polished Writer?</h2>
<p>Some people are fuzzy thinkers, like me. Our minds do not work in a linear fashion, We jump from one train of thought to another in a heartbeat. Though verbal communication might not be our strong suite, writing certainly can be. Writing being strictly a linear form of communication, trains your mind to focus on one thing at a time.</p>
<h3>Writing to influence other people</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s the secret to making people do what you want them to do, <strong>Write to them</strong>. And based on how you write,  you can make them want to do something, like change their habits or buy your products.</p>
<p>If you want to get a job, then you need a well-written Resume and Cover letter. If you can&#8217;t influence the Hiring Manager to take the time to go through your resume, then you have failed. <strong>Our success in any field depends on our ability to influence others</strong>. Once you understand this, you will begin to feel the omnipresent power of the written word.</p>
<p>In order to progress on the professional front, the number one skill you need to have is good communication, both verbal and written. If you can condense your thoughts, and deliver them in a concise manner, then you have the world with you.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Story telling as it applies to businees isint about spinng a yarn or a fairly tail. Rather its about how your business exist in the real world: Who you are and what you do for the benefit of others, and how you add value to peoples lives.—Ann Hadely</p></blockquote>
<h3>Writing to Discover yourself</h3>
<p>Writing goes beyond communication, it holds the key for Self Discovery. Through this art, you learn more about yourself, the way you think, your deepest fears, and your highest dreams. Writing, draws out the intangible thoughts inside our minds and gives it a form so that we can understand them better. Often what makes us worry is the ambiguous and intangible nature of our fears, we are scared of the things we can&#8217;t comprehend. <strong>Writing becomes the act of giving a form to our thoughts, capturing the demons in our head.</strong></p>
<p>Like many writers will tell you, <strong>There is something magical about writing</strong>. Write down your dreams, and it will come true. Write down your fears, understand them, and they will haunt you no more.</p>
<blockquote><p>We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect—Anais Nin</p></blockquote>
<h2>How to Improve your writing</h2>
<p>My writing journey began when I decided to start a blog. I created one on WordPress, started writing and never stopped. You can take a similar path or start simple.</p>
<p>My goal is to make you aware of your writing and make a regular habit out of it. Once you take your writing seriously, you realize how difficult it can be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about fiction—where you have to pull a story and characters from the ether, adding swirls and twirls to entice and capture your readers—but presenting cold hard facts through the medium of nonfiction. In many ways, the work of a nonfiction writer is hard, as he is accountable to the facts he is presenting.</p>
<p><strong>The way to begin one&#8217;s writing journey is by reading.</strong> Yes, read great works of literature and learn how they use words, analogies, and how they follow and break rules of grammar. Listen to their voice and understand their style of writing. <strong>Read, be inspired, and write</strong>. This should be your starting point but by any means don&#8217;t get stuck here.</p>
<h3>Flexing your writing muscles: Going to the Writer&#8217;s gym</h3>
<p>Ideally, you should write early, and write every day. Designate a quiet place for writing, clear all distractions, relax and start.</p>
<p>Start by lifting featherweights, 100 words or even 250 words in a single sitting, once you are able to lift these featherweights regularly and without much difficulty, increase the weights. Move on to 500 words then to 750. Only increasing the weights when you are able to comfortably and regularly lift the previous weights.</p>
<p>When you can lift 750 words about a certain topic in one sitting without much difficulty, take pride in your ability, you have accomplished a great deal.</p>
<h3>Overcoming the starting challenges</h3>
<blockquote><p>“Writers don’t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the one who sat down to write it.”—William Zinsser</p></blockquote>
<p>Staring at a blank page and thinking about what to write is the worst thing I dread. To create something from nothing requires a great deal of effort. &#8220;What should I write about&#8221;,&#8221;How do I write about it&#8221;,&#8221;How will the final product look like&#8221; these are all doubts that faze me, even now. No matter how much you write, starting from scratch will be the hardest part of the process.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You are writing for yourself. Dont try to visualize the great mass audience, every reader is different. Editors and readers dont know what they want to read until they have read it.”—William Zinsser</p></blockquote>
<p>When I&#8217;m thinking of writing about something, I usually have scattered thoughts—some vague ideas I want to convey—and mostly, only one in ten of those thoughts are really helpful. So I begin collecting those thoughts by writing them down. These small bits of words represent the main idea I want to convey in my writing.</p>
<p>Once I have collected the ideas, I go back and expand on each one, adding more details and filling the gaps. These ideas begin to grow into paragraphs. When every idea is worked on and expanded, I go through the entire article and assemble the different paragraphs, adding transition elements, to give a smooth flow from one paragraph to the other, which the reader can follow. <strong>Great writing isn&#8217;t </strong><strong>written, as much as assembled.</strong></p>
<p>For when you are really stuck</p>
<p>Creating the first draft is going to be the hardest step. And like Jackie Chan in the Drunken Master, Sometimes writing without constraint is good for you. Practice a method called <strong>Brain Vomiting</strong>. Just like regular vomiting, the objective is the same—get stuff out. This is where you Write like you are drunk, hold  nothing back, edit nothing, don&#8217;t even check for spelling, just keep writing what your brain is throwing up. By all means write like shit, give yourself permission to be the worst writer in the world. Once done, you can either rework the gibberish into better gibberish or trash it, you will still gain more experience by putting words on paper. This is a good way to get yourself unstuck when writing.</p>
<p>When your ugly first draft is done, let it rest. It needs time—so do you—to marinate and soak up all the ideas. If you can, put one day between your first draft and further edits.</p>
<h3>Going from good to great</h3>
<p>Once you flesh out your idea, it&#8217;s time to become the reaper. Trim the fat and the bloat, most amateur writers stop at the first draft, but I know you won&#8217;t, you will rework it, taking out elements that don&#8217;t fit and beating the rest of it into shape. Be ruthless, Cull weakling verbs and redundant sentences. Each word you use should earn their place in the sentence. Each line should build on the idea from the previous line. Your first draft will reduce considerably and what you will be left with is the original idea in its clearest form.</p>
<blockquote><p>Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words — Mark Twain</p></blockquote>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<blockquote><p>A point of the craft. if you master the tools of the trade—the fundamentals of interviewing and of orderly construction—and if you bring to the assignment your general intelligence and your humanity. You can write about any subject. That&#8217;s your ticket to an interesting life.—Willian Zinsser</p>
<p>A writer who waits for the ideal condition under which to work will die without putting a word on paper—E.B. White</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Dogs might be Man&#8217;s best friends, but books are a close second. There is something magical about holding a book in your hands, it slows your thought and allows your brain to absorb knowledge. Our phones are always up to date but, we never think of updating ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the right books, you can learn anything on your own, no subject is out of your reach. The time has come. Break free from the Highschool mentality and start learning in the real world. Read more, not just fiction, but books that fundamentally change your perspective, books which split your life to a Before Book (BB) and an After Book (AB).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;re a few of my personal favorites, you can start with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2636"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2dREQld">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a>, by Robert B Cialdini</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2dREQld"><img class="alignleft" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512-B-1yXuL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="Influence Psychology of persuation" width="151" height="227" /></a>Humans are emotional beings, with the right stimulus, we are easily influenced. This book is a classic, and The best book on Influencing humans ever written. Robert Cialdini unravels the simple reasons of &#8216;Why we do-What we do&#8217; <strong>When you get down to it, We humans are nothing but animals with iPhones.</strong> The majority of our actions are influenced by our emotions. We may not be as rational as we think we are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a marketer, you need to read this book. You understand The power Authority holds over us, How to get people to like a brand by the power of Social proof, and even the infamous &#8216;Good Cop/ Bad Cop&#8217; routine.</p>
<blockquote><p>“With the sophisticated mental apparatus we have used to build world eminence as a species, we have created an environment so complex, fast-paced, and information-laden that we must increasingly deal with it in the fashion of the animals we long ago transcended.”</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2MOZ1">On writing well</a>, by William Zinsser</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2e2MOZ1"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41EBnx45BBL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="On Writing well, William Zinsser" width="155" height="233" /></a>This book forms the core of my writing. Anyone who takes writing seriously should read this book. William Zinsser lays down the foundation for going from, good to a great writer. He taught me that writing is hard work. A clear sentence is no accident. The secret, he says, to good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components, clear thinking becomes clear writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Writers don&#8217;t just write what comes naturally. They sit down to commit an act of literature, and the self who emerges on paper is far stiffer than the one who sat down to write it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The product that any writer has to sell is not the subject being written about, but who he or she is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Writing is an act of Ego, you might as well admit it. Use its energy to keep you going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are writing for yourself. Dont try to visualize the great mass audience, every reader is different. Editors and readers dont know what they want to read until they have read it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2eiaAiO">Rich Dad poor Dad</a> &#8211; Robert </strong>Kiyosaki</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://amzn.to/2eiaAiO"><img class="alignleft " src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Yyzvo-TOL.jpg" alt="Rich dad poor dad" width="160" height="262" /></a>If you are a recent college graduate or in your first job and know nothing about personal finance, you need this book. Robert Kiyosaki lays the ground rules, the fundamentals of how to get rich and stay rich. The rules that make the rich richer and the poor poorer. How taxes were first implemented for the rich and then trickled downwards. He explains the need for Financial IQ, to be able to read numbers (Accounting) and understand them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rule#1 know the difference between an Asset and a Liability and buy Assests. An Asset puts money in your pocket every month, and A liability takes money out of your pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;our culture has educated us into beleving that the love for money is the root of all evil. It has encouraged us to learn a profession so that we can work for money, but failed to teach us how to have money work for us. It taught us not to worry about our fiantial fututre because our company or the government would take care of us when our working days are over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key to becoming welthy is the ability to convert ordianry income into passive or portfolio income as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

alt="Everybody writes" width="184" height="274" />One of my favorite books on writing in the modern age. This book is like batman&#8217;s utility belt. It has everything you need to fight crime (optional). It combines the rules for writing good English with all the tools and knowledge required by the modern writer. Hadley taught me to embrace my ugly first draft and not let the tyranny of the finished product stop me from writing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Story telling as it applies to businees isint about spinng a yarn or a fairly tail. Rather its about how your business exist in the real world: Who you are and what you do for the benefit of others, and how you add value to peoples lives.</p>
<p>A Compelleing brand story is kind of a gift that gives your audience a way to connect with you as  a person to another and to view your business as whatt it is; a living, breathing entity run by real people offering real value.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shockproof, Shit detector.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/2eDt0h0">How to win Friends and influence People</a>, by Dale Carnegie</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2687" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL.jpg" alt="How to win friends and influence people" width="188" height="298" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL.jpg 1616w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL-189x300.jpg 189w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL-768x1217.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/810IASGMUYL-646x1024.jpg 646w" sizes="(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px" />This is one of the classics, Written in simple English Carnegie explains how the internal clocks of men tick and how we can make them do the things we want without forcing them. Written in a time long forgotten, the rules still apply even today. Everyone should read this book at least once. I often wonder why this book is not taught in school. Kids need to learn these fundamental life skills instead of those useless complex differential equations. This book has helped me a lot when it comes to dealing with people, I&#8217;m always polite and never get mad easily—a trait I got from this book.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Say to yourself over and over: “My popularity, my happiness, and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Action spring out of what we fundamentally desire&#8230;and the best piece of advice which can be given to would-be persuaders, whether in business, in the home, in schools, or in politics, is: <strong>First, arouse in the other person an eager want.</strong> He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walk a lonely way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You will be the same today and in five years, except for the people you meet, and the books you read&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyday my mind is on a quest. A quest to find a reasonable excuse for me to not do anything. Everybody needs a reason to do something and a reason not to do something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most people listen to the voice inside their head telling them what to do and like them, I also have one in my head. I call him Greg (egregious). <strong>&#8216;<em>Greg the worrier</em>&#8216;</strong> has prevented me from doing many things I wanted to do. He&#8217;s very good at convincing me. All I have to do is listen to him, and the more I listen to him, the more sense he makes.  <span id="more-2562"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg has excellent memory—even better than me—he can remember all my past failure in an instant. And he&#8217;s very good at organizing my failures and presenting them to me. Greg is my best friend sometimes, we often talk about all the good things that happened in the past and what the future is going to be. But Greg has a problem. He&#8217;s a chronic worrier. I know he&#8217;s only looking out for me, but most times, it gets in the way. He&#8217;s very cautious and does not like to take risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s how a usual conversation takes place between me and Greg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[Walking outside and seeing a girl I know]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- I think she&#8217;s alone, I should go talk her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg- Na, she is obviously busy with something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- She&#8217;s looking this way should I make eye contact?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg- What if she talks to you? What are you going to say?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- Too late she saw me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>*walks up to girl*</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;Hi there!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Girl- &#8220;Hi.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;How are you today?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her- &#8220;Fine, you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- &#8220;I&#8217;m good, you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>*awkward silence*</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Me- Greg, I need your help. Greg?&#8230;.Greg?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg-*<em>wispers</em>* I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(It&#8217;s like God is challenging me to get girls on Legendary Mode.)</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">The Omnipresent Greg.</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I know I&#8217;m not alone, many people have their own versions of Greg controlling their actions. Greg is powerful and very convincing once you listen to him. But sometimes Greg is wrong. Almost 90% of the things he makes me worry about, never happen. Greg does so because he is programmed to respond to my strongest emotion. Fear. Our Ancestors feared the dark and all that lay hidden in it. Lions and Leopards are no longer part of our Concrete jungle but we fear something of equal magnitude, social embarrassment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg works with our past, and if you&#8217;re like me and did not have pleasant memories in high school , there&#8217;s a lot more things Greg can make you worry about. Sometimes it becomes a challenge to do simple tasks—like talking to a small group of people—when your own mind is conspiring against you.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How to keep Greg Grounded.</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I need to convince Greg that there are no more lions in the dark and that nobody from the audience is going to strangle me. I don&#8217;t have complete control over my mind, if I let him, he will squeeze into every corner of thought I have.</p>
<blockquote class="alignright"><p>&#8220;To stop Greg all you have to do is prove him wrong.<br />
Do that enough times and he will shut up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg only has so much power as you let him. One of the best ways I found to deal with him is, to not listen to him. It&#8217;s very hard, especially when doing something you&#8217;re afraid of. If it helps, know that everybody out there has something they fear, even the brave ones. The extroverts are right, sometimes it better not to think. I know the first time I went to talk to my high school crush, I was standing there thinking what I was going to say, then my friend pushed me in front of her—I would not have gone otherwise—and I just said what came to my mind and it went okay.(better than I imagined)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg is only as good as the information he has to work with, you can update what he runs on by learning new things, reading books, mastering a new language or an instrument. The best thing about this is that once you start proving Greg wrong, he tends to quiet down. The more you expand your comfort zone the better you become.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just be sure not to get stuck at the acquiring information stage (<em>Analysis Paralysis</em>). Cover the basics, get on your feet and do it, fill in the information gaps as you go.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Final thoughts</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We all have a voice inside our head guiding us throughout our life. It makes sense to listen to your gut, but know when to stop. Our minds are programmed to fear what we don&#8217;t know. The infinite possible scenarios our mind cooks up never happens. Ignorance is indeed bliss, sometimes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next time fear takes a grip, know where it comes from, poor Greg must be scared. Don&#8217;t listen to him, just do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop thinking and prove Greg wrong.</p>

<p>Can a butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon create a hurricane in Europe a few weeks later? This is the concept of The Butterfly effect—so named as the computer model that led to its discovery resembles a butterfly—discovered by <strong>Edward Lorentz</strong>. Lorentz  ran weather models with present atmospheric conditions to arrive at the values for tomorrow, he then put the resulting values back in to obtain the conditions of the next day and so on. After many iterations, he found a large variation in the result from the actual condition. On closer inspection, it was observed that every time the new values were put back into the system there was a seemingly small roundoff error at the sixteenth decimal place. This small change was enough to produce a vast difference in the results.<span id="more-2545"></span></p>
<p>The butterfly effect refers to the idea that a butterfly&#8217;s wings might create tiny changes in the atmospheric pressure which combined with other compounding elements may lead to, dissipate or alter the path of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power the tornado, it merely acts as an initial perturbation for the system. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the systems might have been vastly different.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific jargon</strong>: In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.</p>
<h4>How can we apply the Butterfly Effect in our lives?</h4>
<p>if we move this concept from the world of science and apply it  in our lives, a new perspective emerges. To put it in simple terms, the seemingly insignificant choices we make every day can have a large impact on our lives. We do not know how far the ripples of our decision reach. We might consider the everyday interaction between people as trivial, but it can change the entire course of the day for someone.</p>
<p>Suppose you didn&#8217;t have a good night sleep and wake up in a grumpy mood. You are making the morning coffee and your spouse  tells you about an important meeting today, you pay no interest, maybe even act rash. The other person feels offended and his/her mood also deteriorate. Now he carries with him traces of your bad mood and it spreads to everyone he meets on the way to work, from the taxi driver to the assistant. Who then spread it to other people, and thus a chain reaction is set up. He goes into the meeting disinterested, and makes bad decisions. The companies profits go down, he lost the promotion or worse was let go.</p>
<p>Now consider, on the other hand, you woke up in a good mood and cleared your mind. Your spouse can feel it too. Now he goes happily to work, spreading his cheer all along the way, from the taxi driver to the assistant, everyone can feel the effects of your good mood. He goes into the meeting clear-headed and confident. makes the right decisions, profits soar, the company is happy and he gets a promotion.</p>
<p>see how something as small as our mood can set up a chain reaction affecting a lot of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It used to be thought that the events that changed the world were things like big bombs, maniac politicians, huge earthquakes, or vast population movements, but it has now been realized that this is a very old-fashioned view held by people totally out of touch with modern thought. The things that really change the world, according to Chaos theory, are the tiny things. A butterfly flaps its wings in the Amazonian jungle, and subsequently a storm ravages half of Europe.”<br />
― Neil Gaiman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that it&#8217;s not possible to be happy all the time but, the one thing which we can do is to not let our melancholy affect those around us, be it our kids, spouse, co-workers etc. It&#8217;s hard to be cheerful when times are tough and some situation warrants otherwise. But in daily life, most of our problem are solvable without overthinking and worry.</p>
<p>Our behaviour is the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with. Choose them wisely. There are people who are emotional waste dumps, spreading their eternal mystery among friends and co-workers. Stay away from these people who contribute nothing to your life and are constantly bringing you down.</p>
<h4>How can we change the world?</h4>
<p>Start with a something simple. <strong>One random act of kindness a day.</strong> Let these kind butterflies flap their wings and create storms of kindness everywhere around the world. It can be something as simple as helping an old lady cross the street. If an act of kindness is too big a step, then try smiling. Smile at coworkers, strangers on the street, and people  on the subway. It can be hard for many people to smile at strangers, especially for introverts like me. For them, I propose that they execute it in stages, starting with people you know and progressing towards random people on the streets.</p>
<p>Over time these small changes become habits, and there is no better way to change your life than by changing your habits. Charles Duhigg in his book &#8216;The power of habit&#8217; defines a habit, as the choices that all of us deliberately make at one time and stop thinking about,  but continue doing it , often every day. Our small actions can change the course of history, but we may not know it directly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Each smallest act of kindness, reverberates across great distances and spans of time affecting lives unknown to the one who’s generous spirit, was the source of this good echo. Because kindness is passed on and grows each time it’s passed until a simple courtesy becomes an act of selfless courage, years later, and far away. Likewise, each small meanness, each expression of hatred, each act of evil.”<br />
― Dean Koontz</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2413" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/camera-photography-vintage-lens-300x199.jpg" alt="Photography History and Technology" width="837" height="555" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/camera-photography-vintage-lens-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/camera-photography-vintage-lens-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/camera-photography-vintage-lens-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/camera-photography-vintage-lens.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a time long forgotten—before the iPhone—many pioneers were faced with a challenging task. How to capture light and store it in a medium? It was a formidable task indeed, because as far as we know, we cannot capture light in a bottle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The term &#8216;Photography&#8217; was coined by English mathematician and Astronomer <strong>John</strong> <strong>Hershel</strong> in 1839. It was created from the Greek roots <i>phōtos, meaning </i>light and <i>graphé, </i>meaning drawing, they combine to give  &#8216;Drawing with light&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Photography, as we know today, did not originate as a hobby for the masses. It has a rich history behind it. From the time when people tried to capture light using metallic plate coated with silver to the invention of the first film camera, the story unfolds over a hundred years. Before its invention, the only way to capture a slice of time was through paintings. It was tedious and expensive. Photography not only resolved this problem, but it also freed the artist from being bound to reality, he could now paint what feels real to him.<span id="more-1962"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>History of Photography</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The camera obscura (latin for Dark Room) is the predecessor of the pinhole camera. It&#8217;s the phenomenon which occurs when an image of a scene is projected through a tiny hole and onto a screen. For the image to be clear the room had to be dark. It was used as a drawing aid in the mid 16th century. Sometimes, lenses are used to increase the aperture so that a usable brightness of the image can be obtained.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The greek philosopher <strong>Aristotle</strong> observed and noted this idea in 330 BC when he questioned how the sun could make a circular image when it shined through a square hole.</p>
<div id="attachment_2245" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2245" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7243724172_79e3dc45c2_b.jpg" alt="Solar Eclipse through leaf canopy" width="1024" height="720" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7243724172_79e3dc45c2_b.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7243724172_79e3dc45c2_b-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/7243724172_79e3dc45c2_b-768x540.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Solar Eclipse through leaf canopy. The tiny holes in the leaves follow the same optics as that of the pinhole camera, projecting the image of the sun.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1614, <strong>Angelo Sala</strong> demonstrated that powdered <strong>silver nitrate</strong> is blackened by the sun, as was the paper wrapped around it. In 1777, the chemist <strong>Carl Wilhelm Scheele</strong> was studying the more intrinsically light-sensitive <strong>silver chloride</strong> and determined that light disintegrated it to microscopic dark particles of metallic silver.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1816<strong> Joseph Nicephore Niepce</strong> made the first photographic image with a camera obscura.  Using a paper coated with silver chloride, he succeeded in photographing the images in a small camera, but he could only capture negatives, darkest where the camera image was lightest and vice versa, and they were not permanent. Niépce could not find a way to prevent the coating from darkening all over when it was exposed to light for viewing.</p>
<div id="attachment_2260" style="width: 187px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" wp-image-2260 alignright" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-louis_daguerre_2.jpg?w=234" alt="Louis Daguerre" width="177" height="223" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Louis Daguerre</p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1833 <strong>Louis Daguerre</strong> experimented with photographing camera images directly onto a mirror-like silver-surfaced plate fumed with iodine vapor,  which reacted with the silver to form a coating of<strong> silver iodide</strong>.  It produced positive images when it was suitably lit and viewed. But the exposure times were still impractically long. Imagine sitting with your camera for 8 hours to take a photo, the sun would have moved to the west and the resulting image would be bereft of any shadows.</p>
<div id="attachment_2271" style="width: 699px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2271" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-boulevard_du_temple_by_daguerre.jpg" alt="&quot;Boulevard du Temple&quot;, taken by Daguerre in 1838 in Paris" width="689" height="495" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-boulevard_du_temple_by_daguerre.jpg 800w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-boulevard_du_temple_by_daguerre-300x216.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-boulevard_du_temple_by_daguerre-768x552.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Boulevard du Temple&#8221;, taken by Daguerre in 1838 in Paris, the earliest known candid photograph of a person. The image shows a busy street, but because the exposure was several minutes, the moving traffic is not visible. However, at the lower left, a man apparently having his boots polished, and the bootblack polishing them, were motionless enough for their images to be captured.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_2276" style="width: 247px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-2276 alignright" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-william_henry_fox_talbot2c_by_john_moffat2c_1864.jpg?w=237" alt="William Henry Fox Talbot" width="237" height="300" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-william_henry_fox_talbot2c_by_john_moffat2c_1864.jpg 800w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-william_henry_fox_talbot2c_by_john_moffat2c_1864-237x300.jpg 237w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/800px-william_henry_fox_talbot2c_by_john_moffat2c_1864-768x971.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">William Henry Fox Talbot</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Daguerre made the pivotal discovery that a slightly invisible or latent image produced on such a plate by a much shorter exposure could be developed to full visibility by mercury fumes. This brought the required exposure time down to a few minutes under optimum conditions. A strong hot solution of common salt served to fix the image by removing the remaining silver iodide. &#8220;I have seized the light – I have arrested its flight!&#8221;  Daguerre said, upon seeing the image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1840, <strong>Henry Fox Talbot</strong> invented the <strong>calotype</strong> process which, like Daguerre&#8217;s process, used the principle of chemical development of a faint latent image to reduce the exposure time to a few minutes. A Paper with a coating of silver iodide was exposed in the camera and developed into a translucent negative image. It is stabilized by either washing it in potassium bromide, which converted the remaining silver iodide to silver bromide, or by dipping in a solution of hot sodium thiosulphate to wash away the remaining silver iodide particles. Multiple positives could be made from the translucent negative images by simple contact printing. This gave it an important advantage over the daguerreotype process, which produced an opaque original positive that could only be duplicated by copying it with a camera.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There was an increasing demand for Portraiture from the middle classes during the Industrial Revolution. This demand, which could not be met in volume and in cost by oil painting, added to the push for the development of photography.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1884 <strong>George Eastman</strong>, of Rochester, New York, developed dry gel on paper or film, to replace the photographic plate so that a photographer no longer needed to carry boxes of plates and toxic chemicals around. In July 1888 Eastman&#8217;s <strong>Kodak camera</strong> went on the market with the slogan &#8220;You press the button, we do the rest&#8221;. Now anyone could take a photograph and leave the complex parts of the process to others, and photography became available for the mass-market in 1901 with the introduction of the <strong>Kodak Brownie</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the invention of the Brownie, photography was not something the ordinary people indulged in. The Brownies revolutionized the photography industry by the sheer volume of sales, Millions were sold. The first brownies were sold with film installed to take 100 shots and after the roll was over, the entire camera was returned to the company for developing the images. The revolution came 12 years after when <strong>Frank Brownell</strong> designed the new Kodak Brownie in which the film could be taken out and developed by Kodak stockists, chemists or even at home. The camera was sold for a sum of $1 and the film could be developed for $2. This made it very affordable. The camera had lean features, a single shutter speed, a narrow aperture which provided a large depth of field, a basic viewfinder, and the lens could not be focused.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Single Lens Reflex camera (SLR)</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_2345" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2345" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-lei0440_leica_iiif_chrom_-_sn-_580566_1951-52-m39_blitzsynchron_front_view-6531_hf.jpg" alt="Leica IIIf viewfinder camera, 1951" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-lei0440_leica_iiif_chrom_-_sn-_580566_1951-52-m39_blitzsynchron_front_view-6531_hf.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-lei0440_leica_iiif_chrom_-_sn-_580566_1951-52-m39_blitzsynchron_front_view-6531_hf-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-lei0440_leica_iiif_chrom_-_sn-_580566_1951-52-m39_blitzsynchron_front_view-6531_hf-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Leica IIIf viewfinder camera, 1951</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the Invention of the single lens reflex, all cameras with <strong>viewfinders</strong> had two optical paths: one through the lens to the film, and another positioned above  or to the side. Because the viewfinder and the film lens cannot share the same optical path. The viewing lens is aimed to intersect with the film lens at a fixed point in front of the camera. This is okay for taking pictures at a middle or longer distances, but parallax caused framing errors in close-up shots. Moreover, focusing a fast lens when it is opened to wider apertures is not easy. And the viewed image could be significantly different from the final image.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How did they focus old film cameras?</h4>
<div id="attachment_2351" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2351" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-cnam-img_0551.jpg" alt="A Foca camera, 1947" width="1024" height="686" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-cnam-img_0551.jpg 1024w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-cnam-img_0551-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1024px-cnam-img_0551-768x515.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">A Foca camera with a rangefinder, 1947</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an earlier viewfinder camera, the photographer had to estimate the relative distance between him and the subject and set the focus by rotating the dial on the focusing ring. Some earlier film cameras were equipped with a <strong>rangefinder</strong>, this helps the photographer measure the distance between the camera and the subject,   Most varieties of rangefinder show two images of the same subject, one of which moves when a calibrated wheel is turned. When the two images coincide and fuse into one, the distance can be read off the wheel and the photographer is required to transfer the value to the lens focus ring to keep the image in focus. It becomes quite arduous when shooting at different focal lengths.</p>
<div id="attachment_2358" style="width: 970px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2358" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/e30cutmodel.png" alt="Cut out of a modern DSLR camera." width="960" height="711" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/e30cutmodel.png 960w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/e30cutmodel-300x222.png 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/e30cutmodel-768x569.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cut out of a modern DSLR camera.              <a href="http://www.scottishbrochs.com/workshop/workshop1.html">Image source</a></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <b>single-lens reflex camera</b> (<b>SLR</b>) uses a mirror and prism system that permits the photographer to view through the lens and see exactly what will be captured. A viewing image that will be exposed onto the negative exactly as it is seen. When the shutter button is pressed, the mirror flips out of the light path, allowing light to pass through to the film or sensor, capturing the image. There is no parallax error, and focus can be confirmed by eye especially in macro photography and when photographing using telephoto lenses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SLR technology gave us the best preview method available, it gave us the ability to see the world through our cameras. No more guess work, and hoping you got everyone in the shot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the time of cave paintings and even in the renaissance period, people have always wanted to express what they saw around them, to me photography serves that purpose, to tell stories that cannot be told in any other way. We may be prisoners of time, forever transitioning from the past to the present, but with the help of photography, we can hold a precious few of those moments with us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter if you are shooting with your iPhone or a DSLR, we are standing on the shoulders of these giants. Photographers play an important role, we are here to tell stories of the world, how it is, and how it was. We are the only ones who can stop time in its tracks. Happy shooting.</p>

With how way leads on to way, I know I will not cross this path again.<br />
I wish I could take the one less travelled by.<br />
But fear has stopped me from taking a step.<br />
I wish not to be made a fool, my pride insists.<br />
How can I take a step when I know not where it leads.<br />
I think too much of the outcome, yet I forget to begin.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The day the Wright brothers first flew their flying machine changed the course of history. We now have access to what was once the realm of the birds, no longer bound to our Earthly abode.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My fascination with Airplanes began when I saw my first Airshow with my dad. I was 12 years old. I remember walking up to the beach and suddenly from the treeline I heard a large whooshing sound and looked up to see a large gray Helicopter flash by. That was just the beginning. There were all kinds of aerobatics from Synchronized flying to Sky-writing by  Military Jets.<span id="more-1494"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1794" src="https://minimalistsconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088.jpeg" alt="fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088" width="1280" height="848" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088.jpeg 1280w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fighter-jet-jet-aircraft-army-87088-1024x678.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, what went through my mind, was fear. I was scared by the sound and the speed. Then I realized how cool it was, to be a pilot. I wondered what it would be like to be in one of those machines effortlessly cutting its way across the sky. I will forever remember that day as the day I found my life long love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was curious. I wanted to know how they worked. How does a machine that&#8217;s made of metal, float through the air like that? what does it take to become one of the pilots flying it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I tried to learn as much as could about Aircrafts, most of it from watching Television. I remember the day when I set out to make my first helicopter, with my basic understanding of physics. All I knew was I need a propeller spinning very fast to create lift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I took apart an old table fan and cleaned it and oiled it up to make it go fast,  removed all the excess weight of the stand and was left with was the motor, the blade, and the cage. I put the assembly on the floor so that the blade faced downward. and I plugged it in. It was spinning fast. It created a lot of wind but did not lift off like I expected it to. I tried giving it a pull, measuring how much lift it produced and how much weight it needed to lose. It weighed a ton. Hardly any lift at all, I was disappointed. I even got electrocuted, trying to plug the old cable into the socket.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I learned something that day. Big motors, No-No. I needed smaller, lighter  ones. And thus began my journey to take part every toy I had to find motors for my helicopter. I collected propellers from small toys. I would bootstrap designs, but none of them flew. I knew it did not have the power to lift the battery. so my solution was to make it wired. To increase the power, I would add batteries in series. I had burned out the bearing of many motors, they would come to a screeching halt like they are screaming in agony. I was the evil overlord then, torturing my motors until they died.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As time went on my understanding of the laws of flight grew. I understood why helicopters have a tail rotor and realized how my first helicopter design with a single motor and propeller had failed.  I learned about power to weight ratio and was dismayed that all my previous attempts were based on wrong assumptions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of engineering that goes into making an Aircraft. The complex intricacies of Angle of attack, Aerofoil shape, Metacenter, Balance and weight distribution. The more I learned the more I realized I had to learn. It was so deliciously complicated. I didn&#8217;t understand the math behind it, but I understood the principles. How a plane flies, the conditions needed for stable flight and how the Angle of attack comes into play.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How does an Airplane fly</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1795" src="https://minimalistsconfessions.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288.jpeg" alt="pexels-photo-90288" width="1280" height="853" srcset="https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288.jpeg 1280w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/pexels-photo-90288-1024x682.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So how does a plane fly? To put it plainly.<strong> A plane stays up in the air by pushing the air downwards.</strong> The job of the wings is to deflect the air down, thereby keeping the Airplane up.  You can see it in the Joker smile trail left by the aircraft when it moves through clouds. So the faster you go the more air is deflected and the more lift is created. The Angle of attack— the Angle with which the wing meets the oncoming air— is what makes it possible to deflect the air.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wings might look level, but they are not. They are crafted with a specific Angle of attack. Heavy passenger planes like the Airbus A380 needs high Angles to generate more lift and smaller Military jets requires less.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No matter the speed, <strong>An airplane&#8217;s wing generates lift equal to its weight.</strong> If that wasn&#8217;t the case then the aircraft would not be able to fly straight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then what&#8217;s with all the movies in which the pilot screams &#8220;We need more speed, we are not going to make it.&#8221; Well, that because the term &#8216;lift&#8217; means different things to the Pilot and the Engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A pilot is not concerned with the lift an aircraft generates, he is concerned with the angle of attack that gives him that lift.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therein lies the dilemma. We think that like a car, a plane moves in the direction it&#8217;s pointing, but that&#8217;s not true. They are ever so slightly pointing up. Landing a plane is same as drifting a car. They are both moving in a different direction than which they are pointing. That is the difference between Lift and Buoyancy (Lowness of Angle of attack). The pilot can make the plane point upwards and still make it fly in a straight line (Mushing flight).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wright brother&#8217;s fundamental contribution was the development of the 3-Axis control system, which enabled a pilot to keep the plane in equilibrium. The vertical stabilizer keeps the nose of the plane from swinging from side to side (yaw). And the horizontal stabilizer prevents an up-and-down motion of the nose (Pitch).</p>
<div id="attachment_1801" style="width: 719px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-1801" src="http://www.rahulsrajan.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/airplane.gif" alt="Airplane parts Definitions" width="709" height="533" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Airplane parts Definitions</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the pilot pulls back on the stick, the elevator changes position and increases the pitch of the aircraft, thereby increasing the Angle of attack and hence the generating more lift. So what happens if the pitch is increased too much, then a condition called stall occurs and the aircraft falls from the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A stall is when an increase in Angle of attack will not result in an increase in lift of the aircraft. </strong> In a stall, not enough air flows over the wing, which increases the drag, the plane loses speed and hence lift. During landings a plane&#8217;s tendency to stall is increased, the pilot must have a sense of lift (flying Instinct) to know when the aircraft is near to the stall condition and act accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Elevator changes the pitch of the aircraft, but what makes it go up and down is the Throttle.</strong> Increase the throttle and the plane goes up, decrease it and the plane comes down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Helicopters are a whole different story. They are classified as the Rotary wing type aircraft. Although they follow the same physics, the way they fly is entirely different. I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was the kid who tried to make a helicopter out of a table fan. Now, I&#8217;m a Mechanical engineer, but things haven&#8217;t changed much, I still want to build a helicopter. I understand how stupid I was back then, but I&#8217;m glad I was stubborn enough to try. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m the person I am now. My curiosity has only grown in proportion, to my stubbornness of not accepting things as they are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I get goosebumps when I see a pilot deftly making a landing in heavy cross winds. All the conditions that needed to be satisfied to keep that aircraft stable. All the engineering that went into the design, It&#8217;s just beautiful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next time you fly, know the physics of what&#8217;s keeping you in the sky. And enjoy the beautiful Ballet between the Plane and the Air.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;For once you have tasted flight, you will walk the earth with your  eyes Skyward. For there you have been and there you will long to return.&#8217;  -Leonardo Da Vinci</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From the Navigators of the early age to the pilots of today, we have all looked at the stars for guidance and awed at their spectacular beauty. There was a time when we used to worship the sun and the stars. We felt they were gods watching over us. Looking up was heaven, a place we hoped to reach one day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a kid, I always wondered, who lights fires in the sky? why are they there? where do they go during the day? Fascinated by all the Disney movies that told me stars were magic. I would often wish on them for something. Little did I know that they were giant balls of gas, thousands of light year away.<span id="more-1227"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My fascination with the unknown lead me into science. And  what I learned changed my perspective of life. I realized we are all made from Stardust, the universe is inside us. Our atoms came from stars that were millions of light years away. The iron in our blood, the calcium in our bones,  were once made in the fiery crucible of a giant star. Which, upon collapse, exploded and flung its enriched guts all over the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/33609/delicate-arch-sunset-rock-formation-large.jpg" alt="The Milkyway" width="890" height="593" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Astronomy helped me put myself into a perspective larger than my planet, I realized that we are just mere organisms floating on a spec of dirt, orbiting a young star in a small solar system. And that planet Earth is one of countless possible life sustaining planets in the universe. There maybe aliens right now, crowning their next king or electing their next president. I wonder what the Marilyn Monroe of that civilization looks like?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Light is the fastest thing we know. It travels at about 3.0×10<sup>8</sup> m/s. Yet, light from the sun takes 8 minutes to reach us. So if the sun were to explode, we would not know about it until after 8 minutes. It takes light 4.3 years to reach our nearest star (Alpha Centauri). The universe we can see is just a reflection of how it was when the light left that star or Galaxy. That means from some distant point of the universe if we look at the Earth, we can see dinosaurs roaming the planet. The deeper we look the farther in time we can see.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/2150/sky-space-dark-galaxy-large.jpg" alt="" width="890" height="639" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our planet is nearly perfect for life. It&#8217;s at the right distance from the sun (Goldilocks zone). Which enables It to have liquid water on the surface. It has a moon-one third of its size-revolving around the earth to give us our tides and stabilize its rotation. The earth is also inclined at a perfect angle so as to have its four seasons.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How did life begin on this planet? We believe that the first single-celled organisms evolved out of hot pools of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. They are called LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor).  I&#8217;m grateful for those brave organisms which fought its way into existence despite the hard conditions. For without them, life would not have flourished on this planet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/30257/pexels-photo-30257-large.jpg" alt="Shooting star" width="890" height="566" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Though my soul may set in darkness, it will rise in perfect light;<br />
I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night.          <i>— Sarah Williams</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Space is our final frontier, we have sailed across the sea, mapped the ocean floor, covered our planet with satellites, sent probes to distant planets. The next step will be to make space more accessible. In time our technology may take us to distant planets and colonize them.<img class="alignright" src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/2152/sky-earth-space-working-large.jpg" alt="Astronaut" width="298" height="297" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one profound fact that Astronomy taught me is that , though our appearance may be different. We are a single species on a fragile planet, in a vast cosmos. No matter what the things we invent to separate ourselves from other people (religion, nationality, race).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Like Astronaut Alexander Gerst said, &#8220;I see no borders from up here.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next time you look at the night sky, know that the light you see is older than your Grandparents. Its journey of millions of miles came to an end in your eyes, so that you can perceive the universe in its entire splendor.</p>
