<h3>My Notes</h3>
<blockquote><p>Leadership is defined as creating a future for others which would not have happened otherwise &#8211; Bryan Franklin</p></blockquote>
<p>For fifty thousand years, humans did what they were passionate about, and then they did something else to eat. I don&#8217;t think there is anything written down that says those days are gone forever.</p>
<blockquote><p>People have this idea that either you&#8217;re a cog in the machine, just working for the man, or youré out singing on stage, making your living that way It seems like there is a lot in between.</p></blockquote>
<p>The very best thing you can do when starting a business is to keep your overheads as low as possible and make sure you are getting recurring revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Iteration Velocity</strong> &#8211; When creating a new offering, your primary goal should be to work through each iteration cycle as quickly as possible. An iteration is a structured form of learning that helps you make your offering better. The faster you learn the more quickly you improve.</p>
<blockquote><p>The ardent or insane pursuit of a goal is a good idea if the steps you take along the way prep you for other outcome s each almost as good (or better). If bending the market to your will and shipping on time and doing important and scary work are all things you need to develop along the way, then it really doesn&#8217;t matter much if you don&#8217;t make the goal you set out to reach &#8211; Seth Godin</p></blockquote>
<p>The amount of money you earn is the measure of the value that others place on your contribution.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can have anything you want in life, if you will just help other people get what they want &#8211; Zig Ziglar</p></blockquote>
<p>If you can get people who don&#8217;t know about you to know about you (marketing) and you can convert them into customers (sales) and once they&#8217;re customers, you can lead them from point A to point B, you can accomplish anything on the planet.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sell them what they want and give them what they need &#8211; Eben pagan</p></blockquote>
<p>If you try to sell a solution before you&#8217;ve muttually agreed on the problem &#8211; which most salespeople do &#8211; People are mostly not interested.</p>
<p>The essence of building your own brand, people having heard of you &#8211; and having a positive impression &#8211; before you&#8217;ve even met them. If you can create that, doors open for you.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurial mindset &#8211; Always look for the highest leverage thing that could be accomplished, and then get it done. Never wait for permission or instructions to make things better.</p>
<p>A reasonable man adapts to his environment. An unreasonable man persists in attempting to adapt his environment to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.</p>
<p>A startup needs to learn about the problem, the solution, who the customers are, and getting all these pieces to fit together. An early stage startup is a set of assumptions and you need to test those assumptions systematically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me something that you think is true that very few people agree with.&#8221;</p>
