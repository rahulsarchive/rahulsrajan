<p>I&#8217;m like the majority of 20 somethings when it comes to food habits, which is &#8216;<strong>Eat whatever I like, whenever I like</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p>We quarter-lifers are under a lot of pressure ( college graduation, jobs, starting a family). We find solace and comfort in the foods we eat. They are like therapy.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t blame us for having some extra therapy, we need it. It&#8217;s no wonder the majority of people today are obese or on their way there. I was following the same path.<span id="more-1092"></span></p>
<p>What happened to me was, I got this <em>wonderful</em> condition called <b>Acid reflux</b> (sarcasm). At first, I didn&#8217;t even know about it. There were only occasional throat pains every few weeks and the doctor would prescribe antibiotics, <em><strong>because Antibiotics fix everything</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Well, they made it worse, It destroyed my <em><strong>Intestinal Flora</strong></em>, which were protecting me and laid waste to my stomach.</p>
<p>It was not long after when I started getting chest pain along with throat pain and googling my symptoms did not make me feel better. Trust me, <strong>Never google your symptoms</strong>.</p>
<p>My anxiety sped up the process, soon I went to see a Gastroenterologist. I got admitted and underwent an Endoscopy (not pleasant) and my diagnosis was Antral Gastritis.</p>
<p>After a few week of proton pump inhibitors, my symptoms were subsiding.</p>
<p>But it is not a long-term solution. The only way is to properly control your diet. I&#8217;m sort of a panicky person. So it has been difficult to stay calm.</p>
<p><strong>Trust me Acid reflux is an Insidious condition, it won&#8217;t go down easily.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m stressing the importance of a good diet. processed foods may have increased our palates but they are not a substitute for raw-cooked food.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learned my lesson, I&#8217;m trying my best to eat organic but it&#8217;s difficult and expensive. compared with the availability and cheapness of processed items.</p>
<blockquote><p>The best investment you can make to your health insurance is, to eat good food.</p></blockquote>
<p>So kids, always listen to your mother when she says &#8216;eat your vegetables&#8217;.</p>
